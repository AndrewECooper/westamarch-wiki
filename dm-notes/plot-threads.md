# Developing Plot Threads

This document contains plot concepts, theories, and potential developments that have not yet been introduced to the party. These are planning notes for future narrative developments.

**Status:** Concept only. Details to be developed before introduction.

---

## The Greenheart Fragment

### Concept

While the Warren Anchor Stone was damaged and leaking, a fragment of [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) consciousness escaped into Westmarch. It is not the Greenheart itself, but a sufficient piece to have sentience and purpose.

**Inspiration:** Similar to Lasciel's shadow in The Dresden Files—separate from the original, operating with incomplete power, capable of independent action, but driven by a singular goal.

### The Fragment's Nature

* A piece of the Greenheart's consciousness, not its full power
* Escaped through the crack before the ward was established
* Now trapped within Westmarch's walls (contained by the city's "civilized energy")
* Has will, intelligence, and purpose
* **Goal:** Reunite with the Greenheart by freeing it

### Potential Capabilities (To Be Developed)

* Influence dreams and emotions?
* Speak to those sensitive to nature (druids, fey, [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill))?
* Accelerate plant growth or corrupt small areas?
* Possess or influence people?
* Manifest physically in limited ways?

### Potential Limitations (To Be Developed)

* Trapped within the city walls?
* Weakened by proximity to functioning Anchor Stones?
* Unable to act directly for long?
* Needs to grow stronger before major action?

### Questions to Resolve

* What form does it take? (Incorporeal presence? Physical host? Diffuse influence?)
* Does it know about the party?
* Is Quill particularly visible to it? (Fey nature, curse, possible former connection)
* What is it doing while the party is in the Thornwood?
* Does anyone in Westmarch sense its presence?

### Narrative Potential

* A villain that operates in the city while [Verdanthis](/dm-notes/conspiracy-tracker) operates in the forest
* Can create B-plots and side missions (strange occurrences)
* Threatens NPCs the party cares about
* Provides a more immediate, personal antagonist
* Can escalate tension even if the party succeeds at main objectives
* Forces confrontation that doesn't require fighting a primordial god

**Status:** Concept only. To be developed before introduction.

## Quill's Origin

### What We Know

* Quill is Fey, born from a vow or promise
* His curse wipes his memory periodically and has done so for over a century
* Each cycle, he loses more of himself (silver hair turning crimson)
* Lady Oona knows who he is and why he was cursed
* She said he "deserved his fate"
* His curse reacted violently to the Anchor Stone

### Working Theory

**Quill was the Greenheart's vassal, bound by oath.**

* He broke that oath (possibly during or after the Green War)
* Because Fey ARE the essence of their vows, breaking an oath is breaking yourself
* The curse is self-inflicted—the natural consequence of a Fey violating its own nature
* Lady Oona finds this entertaining because she embodies Broken Promises—Quill is a monument to her domain

### Questions to Resolve

* What was Quill's original oath to the Greenheart?
* Did he help bind the Greenheart? (Would explain his presence in Westmarch after the Pact)
* Does the Greenheart remember him?
* What happens if Quill drinks from the Singing Pools and the Greenheart senses him?
* Can the curse be broken, and what would that mean?

### Potential Revelations

* Quill's true name and original form
* His role in the Green War or the Binding
* Why he chose to break his oath (if it was a choice)
* Whether restoring his memory would restore his original nature
* What price breaking the curse would require

**Status:** Working theory. Details to emerge through play.

## The Duke's Isolation

### Current State

* [Duke Aldric Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch) knows [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) is failing
* He checks the Central Stone obsessively
* He is paranoid and withdrawn
* He trusts almost no one
* He doesn't know about the conspiracy or his brother's betrayal

### Potential Developments

* The party might seek audience with the Duke
* [Lord Brennan](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch) is now actively interested in finding the Duke's stone
* If Aldric dies or is incapacitated before telling [Sera](/characters/npcs/lady-sera-westmarch) the truth, critical knowledge could be lost
* The Duke and [Mira Thornweaver](/characters/npcs/high-ranger-mira-thornweaver) both have Tier 4 knowledge but aren't coordinating

### Questions to Consider

* Will the party try to contact the Duke directly?
* How will Brennan act on his new interest in Aldric's knowledge?
* Is the Duke in danger from the conspiracy?
* What happens if the party reveals what they know to the Duke?
* Does the Duke suspect his brother?

### The Central Stone

* Located beneath the Citadel
* Larger than the Warren Stone
* The keystone of the entire Binding
* If Brennan discovers its location, it becomes a primary target
* The Duke checks it obsessively—this could make him a witness to sabotage

**Narrative Potential:** The Duke could become an ally, a victim, or an obstacle depending on how the party approaches him and what Brennan learns.

---

## The Ward's Duration

### Current State

The temples have established a ward around the damaged Warren Stone. This is a temporary containment, not a repair.

### Timeline

**Deliberately vague for now.** If the party delays too long, a specific deadline will be introduced to create urgency.

### Potential Complications

* The ward requires regular maintenance (opportunity for sabotage)
* Temple resources are stretched maintaining the ward
* The ward could fail earlier than expected if the stone degrades further
* Other stones failing could cascade the ward's collapse

### Narrative Function

The ward provides breathing room for the party to pursue the [Tess-Kydra](/lore/tess-kydra) without immediate catastrophe, but creates long-term pressure that the situation must be resolved.

---

## The Northwest Stone

### Current Situation

* Located beneath [Lord Brennan's](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch) estate in Northbank
* Has been subtly damaged by Brennan for months
* Not yet in crisis state like the Warren Stone
* The party doesn't know about it yet

### Potential Developments

* Could become the next crisis point if the Warren Stone is repaired
* Discovering this stone could expose Brennan's involvement
* Brennan may accelerate damage if he feels threatened
* [Captain Garrett Stone](/characters/npcs/captain-garrett-stone) has records of incidents near the western wall—this stone may be the cause

### Narrative Potential

This stone provides a second major threat and potential evidence trail that leads directly to Brennan. Timing its discovery is critical to pacing.

---

## The Other Anchor Stones

### Known/Suspected Locations

1. **Warren Stone (South)** - Beneath the Warrens (discovered, damaged, warded)
2. **Central Stone** - Beneath the Citadel (seen in vision, location unknown to party)
3. **Northeast Stone** - At the Greenwatch ([Mira](/characters/npcs/high-ranger-mira-thornweaver) checks it monthly)
4. **Northwest Stone** - Beneath Brennan's estate (being sabotaged)
5. **Archive Stone** - Beneath the Archive of Ioun ([Elara](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) knows of it)
6. **Unknown Location #6**
7. **Unknown Location #7**

### Questions

* Where are the remaining two stones?
* Are any others currently damaged?
* How many must fail before the Binding collapses completely?
* Does the Central Stone hold disproportionate importance?

## Lyrique's Position

### Current Situation

* [Lyrique](/characters/npcs/lyrique) is unwittingly reporting to Brennan
* She believes she's helping coordinate the city's response
* She doesn't know Brennan is a traitor
* The party trusts her (she retrieved Councilor Arissa successfully)

### Potential Developments

* The party might discover her connection to Brennan
* She might discover Brennan's treachery herself
* Brennan might use her to feed false information to the party
* She could become a key ally if she turns against Brennan
* She could be in danger if Brennan decides she knows too much

### Narrative Potential

Lyrique is positioned as a potential tragic figure or dramatic ally depending on how her storyline develops. Her connection to both [Elara](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) (former student) and Brennan (current patron) creates complex loyalty tensions.

---

## The Fey Courts

### Current State

* The Fey were deceived into [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact)
* They're bound to maintain the Binding against their will
* Lady Oona embodies Broken Promises—the Pact itself
* The Fey know the truth but are constrained in what they can reveal

### Potential Developments

* Other Fey may contact the party
* The Fey might aid or hinder depending on their interpretation of their oaths
* If the Binding breaks, the Fey are released from their obligations
* Some Fey might work to free the Greenheart; others might oppose it

### Questions

* What do other Fey courts think of the situation?
* Are there Fey working with Verdanthis?
* What happens to the Fey if the Binding collapses?
* Can the party gain Fey allies, or are all Fey hostile due to the deception?
