# Party Knowledge Tracker

This document tracks what the party has learned, what they suspect, and what they don't know about the conspiracy and the Binding. Updated after Session 3.

**Current Date:** Greenleaf 24th, 1247

## What the Party Knows (After Session 3)

### The Anchor Stones

* There is at least one large stone embedded in bedrock beneath the Warrens, covered in arcane script
* The inscription reads: **ZAN-TA KYDRA TESS AQUA MAGI** ("Suppress it, Stone, Channel to the Water of Vision")
* The stone's purpose is to suppress the forest's vision/perception
* The stone was deliberately damaged—tool marks prove sabotage
* There may be as many as seven such stones in or around Westmarch ([Elara's](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) theory)
* The stones are connected to the city's ancient foundations and [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact)
* Repairing the stone requires Source Stone from the Singing Pools (retrieved) and the [Tess-Kydra](/lore/tess-kydra) (not yet retrieved)

### The Vision

* [Duke Aldric Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch) was seen in a vision kneeling before a large Anchor Stone—larger than the Warren Stone
* The location is unknown (circular chamber, deep underground)
* The Duke knows about the stones and is trying to maintain something
* He mentioned "the South Stone is lost" and "The Great Vow"
* He appeared desperate and afraid
* The vision's timeframe is uncertain (past, present, or future)

### The Fey and the Pact

* The Fey Courts guard the Singing Pools under ancient obligations
* Lady Oona (unnamed to the party) was bound to allow access but extracted a price
* The Fey believe [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) contains "an imbalance in the bargain"
* The Fey know more than they're allowed to say
* More than one person in Westmarch knows the truth about the stones, but they aren't talking to each other

### Quill's Curse

* Lady Oona knew who [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) is and why he was cursed
* She said he "deserved his fate"
* She found his suffering entertaining
* The origin and nature of the curse remain unknown to Quill

### The Tess-Kydra

* An ancient ritual crucible that can store magical power over time
* Required to recharge the Warren Stone after physical repair
* Was captured during the Green War when Harrow Keep fell
* Attributed to kobolds serving the green dragon Verdanthis
* Verdanthis was a known agent of [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) during the war
* The [Poison Scale kobolds](/dm-notes/poison-scale-tribe) still lair at Harrow Keep
* The Tess-Kydra might still be there

### Kaelen's Curse

* [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen) carries "the Sorrow of the Forest"
* Those who serve Westmarch's order instinctively distrust his words
* Disadvantage on Charisma checks against City Watch, Citadel officials, and clergy of Erathis/Bahamut

## What the Party Suspects But Can't Prove

* The Duke has significant knowledge about the Anchor Stones
* There is a deliberate conspiracy, not just natural decay
* The Greenwood Pact may be built on some kind of deception
* Quill's past is connected to the forest and/or the Pact somehow
* Something big and dangerous is being held back by the stones

## What the Party Doesn't Know

### The Nine Major Secrets

1. **The full nature of the Greenheart** - Primordial consciousness, not just "spirit"
2. **That Westmarch itself is a magical prison** - The city exists to imprison the Greenheart
3. **The existence and locations of all seven Anchor Stones** - They know of one for certain, suspect more
4. **That Lord Brennan is a traitor** - He appears to be a helpful ally
5. **That Verdanthis is actively orchestrating events** - They know she existed during the war, not that she's the mastermind
6. **The full terms of the Binding vs. the Pact** - The Pact is public, the Binding is secret
7. **What happens if the Binding fails completely** - The Greenheart awakens and civilization ends
8. **The origin of Quill's curse** - Broken oath to the Greenheart
9. **That a fragment of the Greenheart may have escaped into the city** - See [Plot Threads](/dm-notes/plot-threads)

## What Each Handler Knows and Isn't Sharing

### Elara Moonwhisper

**Knowledge Level:** Tier 3, approaching Tier 4

**What She Knows:**
* The Archive basement contains an Anchor Stone
* The Binding is real
* Seven stones exist

**What She's Sharing:** Everything she knows with Quill. She's an open book.

**What She's Holding Back:** Nothing intentionally—she just doesn't have the full picture yet.

**Current Attitude:** Validated by the party's discoveries. Actively helping research and coordinate repairs.

---

### High Ranger Mira Thornweaver

**Knowledge Level:** Tier 4 (partial)

**What She Knows:**
* The Greenwatch contains an Anchor Stone
* The Rangers' oath has mystical significance
* The Binding is failing
* She was told when she took the position: "This stone maintains the Pact, protect it at all costs"
* She suspects there's much more she wasn't told

**What She's Sharing:** Minimal. Directed Kaelen toward [Archdruid Theron](/characters/npcs/archdruid-theron-mossbark) rather than explaining herself.

**What She's Holding Back:**
* The full truth about the Rangers' role
* Her fears about systemic failure
* Advised Kaelen to keep the vision quiet

**Current State:** Deeply conflicted. She senses systemic failure but doesn't fully understand it. When Kaelen reported the sabotaged stone and the vision of the Duke, she wasn't surprised—but she advised him to keep it quiet to avoid destabilizing the city.

### Lord Brennan Westmarch

**Knowledge Level:** Tier 4+ (Full conspiracy knowledge)

**What He Knows:**
* Everything about the Binding
* His role in the conspiracy
* Everything the party knows (via [Lyrique's](/characters/npcs/lyrique) reports)

**What He's Sharing:** Nothing true. Congratulations and vague concern.

**What He's Holding Back:** Everything. He is the enemy.

**Current Focus:** Very interested in the vision of Duke Aldric. He now wants to know where the stone in the vision is located.

---

### Archdruid Theron Mossbark

**Knowledge Level:** Tier 4 (Full truth)

**What He Knows:**
* The full truth about the Binding
* He was present at the Binding 300 years ago
* The Binding is failing
* He suspects sabotage but doesn't know who is responsible

**What He's Sharing:** Pointed the party toward the Singing Pools. Speaks in riddles.

**What He's Holding Back:** Almost everything. He doesn't trust [Lord Brennan](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch) and is wary of Lyrique's association with him.

**Current Attitude:** He carries centuries of guilt. May share more if the party proves worthy.
