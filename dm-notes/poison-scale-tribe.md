# The Poison Scale Tribe

A small tribe of kobolds (~15-20 total) who serve [Verdanthis](/dm-notes/conspiracy-tracker). They occupy Harrow Keep and guard the stolen [Tess-Kydra](/lore/tess-kydra).

---

## Overview

**Role:** Guardians of the Tess-Kydra

**Current Status:** Occupying Harrow Keep, unaware of the party's approach

**Standing Orders:** Protect the crucible. Kill intruders.

### What They Know

* They guard "the Mother's treasure" on Verdanthis's orders
* They don't know what the Tess-Kydra does or why it matters
* They don't know about the current crisis in Westmarch

---

## Named Members

### Skrix the Claw (Tribe Leader)

**Role:** Tribe Leader and primary guardian

**Description:** Male kobold, oldest and craftiest of the tribe. Wears a crude crown made of painted bone.

**Background:**
* Received the Tess-Kydra with instructions to guard it
* Paranoid and suspicious—knows the crucible is important but not exactly why
* Keeps a carved wooden token he believes lets Verdanthis watch through his eyes (it doesn't)

**Combat Role:** Kobold Scale Sorcerer or Kobold Inventor

**Personality:** Paranoid, cunning, devoted to Verdanthis

---

### Vix (Skrix's Enforcer)

**Role:** Second-in-command and enforcer

**Description:** Female kobold, Skrix's most loyal servant. Larger than most kobolds, surprisingly strong.

**Background:**
* Handles discipline and leads hunting parties
* Secretly thinks Skrix is losing his edge but remains loyal—for now

**Combat Role:** Kobold Dragonshield or reskinned Kobold with extra HP

**Personality:** Brutal, efficient, pragmatic

---

### Tik-Tik (Trapmaster)

**Role:** Trap specialist

**Description:** Male kobold, twitchy and excitable. Responsible for all the traps in Harrow Keep.

**Background:**
* Proud of his work to an obnoxious degree
* If captured, might reveal trap locations in exchange for his life (he's a coward)

**Combat Role:** Kobold Inventor or standard Kobold who triggers traps

**Personality:** Nervous, proud, cowardly when cornered

---

### Niss (Drake Handler)

**Role:** Handler of the tribe's Guard Drake

**Description:** Female kobold, quieter and more competent than she appears. Cares for the tribe's Guard Drake, Thornscale.

**Background:**
* The drake is her only real friend
* She'll fight to the death to protect it

**Combat Role:** Standard Kobold, but the drake defends her aggressively

**Personality:** Quiet, competent, fiercely protective of Thornscale

**Combat Note:** If Niss is killed, Thornscale goes berserk

---

### Old Gruk (Shaman)

**Role:** Tribal shaman and spiritual leader

**Description:** Male kobold, elderly and half-blind. Claims to hear Verdanthis's voice in his dreams (might be true, might be senile).

**Background:**
* Leads the tribe in prayers to "the Great Mother"
* The other kobolds respect him but find him unsettling

**Combat Role:** Kobold Scale Sorcerer (lower level) or non-combatant

**Personality:** Mystical, unsettling, possibly senile or genuinely prophetic

---

### Thornscale (Guard Drake)

**Role:** Tribe guardian beast

**Description:** Guard Drake with greenish-brown scales that blend with the forest.

**Background:**
* Bonded to Niss but obeys Skrix
* Kept near the Tess-Kydra
* If Niss is killed, it goes berserk

**Combat Role:** Guard Drake (standard stats)

---

## Rank and File (8-12 standard kobolds)

**Named individuals:**

* **Reek** - Nervous, always sniffing the air
* **Blink** - Has a twitch, surprisingly observant
* **Snik** - Aggressive, wants to prove himself
* **Mira** - Quieter, follows orders without complaint

**Combat Role:** Standard Kobolds

---

## Combat Guidance

### Tactics

* **Pack Tactics:** Kobolds excel when fighting together
* **Traps:** Tik-Tik has rigged Harrow Keep extensively
* **Drake Support:** Thornscale provides heavy combat power
* **Defensive Position:** They know the keep's layout intimately

### Key Considerations

* **Niss and Thornscale:** If Niss dies, the drake becomes uncontrollable (benefits the party or makes things chaotic)
* **Tik-Tik as Information Source:** If captured alive, he'll betray the tribe to save himself
* **Skrix's Leadership:** If Skrix falls, the tribe's coordination suffers significantly
* **Old Gruk:** May be non-combatant or support caster; unclear if his "visions" grant him real magical insight

### Encounter Balance Notes

* Total force: ~15-20 kobolds + 1 Guard Drake
* Leadership: 2-3 elite kobolds (Skrix, Vix, possibly Tik-Tik or Old Gruk)
* Named specialists provide variety beyond standard kobold tactics
* Traps add environmental hazards and resource drain
