# The Conspiracy

This document tracks the active conspiracy to free the Greenheart by destroying the Binding. Updated after Session 3.

**Current Date:** Greenleaf 24th, 1247

---

## Goals

**Primary Objective:** Free the Greenheart by destroying the Binding.

**Method:** Damage or destroy enough Anchor Stones that the Binding collapses and the Greenheart awakens.

**Secondary Objectives:**

* Prevent repair of damaged stones
* Keep the conspiracy hidden until it's too late
* Destabilize Westmarch politically to slow response
* Remove or neutralize those with Tier 4 knowledge

---

## Key Conspirators

### Verdanthis (Mastermind)

**Role:** Green Dragon, primary antagonist and conspiracy mastermind

**Race/Age:** Green Dragon, ancient (500+ years)

**Current Status:** Active, location unknown (somewhere in the Thornwood)

**Description:** Verdanthis served as the Greenheart's champion during the Green War. She was defeated but not killed—she fled and hid when the Binding was performed. For three centuries, she has been planning her revenge and the Greenheart's liberation.

#### What She's Done

* Recruited [Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch) as her primary agent in the city
* Directed the theft of the [Tess-Kydra](/lore/tess-kydra) during the Green War (or shortly after)
* Established the [Poison Scale kobolds](/dm-notes/poison-scale-tribe) at Harrow Keep to guard it
* Orchestrated the sabotage of the Warren (South) Anchor Stone three months ago
* Instructed Brennan to damage the Northwest Anchor Stone

#### What She Knows

* The full mechanics of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding)
* The location of all seven Anchor Stones (or most of them)
* That the Warren Stone has been warded but not repaired
* That someone is investigating (but may not know specifics about the party)

#### Current Activities

* Commands the Poison Scale kobold tribe
* Actively working toward the Binding's collapse
* Specific near-term plans not yet defined

#### Motivation

Free the Greenheart, destroy civilization, restore the forest's dominance.

### Lord Brennan Westmarch

**Role:** Primary agent within the city

**Race/Age:** Human, 49

**Location:** Estate in Northbank, frequently at court

**Current Status:** Active, maintaining his public persona while gathering intelligence

**Public Persona:** Charismatic and popular—especially with common folk, merchants, and younger nobles—Brennan speaks passionately about "Westmarch's future" and "opportunities for all." He argues the city must be allowed to grow and that the Pact, while important, should evolve with the times. Many see him as a voice of progress and compassion, particularly his support for refugees and the poor.

**True Nature:** A traitor working to free the Greenheart. His public persona of progressive reformer masks his true agenda.

#### What He's Done

* Accepted Verdanthis's mission (timeline and exact circumstances unclear)
* Subtly damaged the Northwest Anchor Stone beneath his estate for months
* Built a political faction advocating for expansion and modernization
* Cultivated agents and informants throughout the city (including [Lyrique](/characters/npcs/lyrique))
* Sent Lyrique to retrieve Councilor Arissa (political opportunity from the crisis)

#### What He Knows

* **Tier 4+ knowledge** - Everything about the Binding and his role in the conspiracy
* Everything the party knows (via Lyrique's reports)
* The Duke appeared in a vision with an Anchor Stone—confirming Aldric has knowledge Brennan suspected but couldn't prove
* The party found the damaged Warren Stone and retrieved Source Stone from the Singing Pools
* [Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) has discovered the Tess-Kydra and its location at Harrow Keep
* The party is considering how to retrieve it

#### Current Focus

Very interested in the vision of [Duke Aldric](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch). He now wants to know where the stone in the vision is located. This could lead him to the Central Stone beneath the Citadel—the keystone of the entire Binding.

#### Next Moves

Likely to:

* Continue gathering intelligence through Lyrique
* Investigate where Aldric's stone might be
* Maintain his public persona while the party does his enemies' work for him
* Possibly interfere with the repair effort if it progresses too far

#### Motivation

Complex. He may genuinely believe freeing the Greenheart is right, or he may have been promised power in the new order. His exact reasoning is not yet fully defined.

#### Known Agents

* Lyrique (unwitting)
* Others unnamed
