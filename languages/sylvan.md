## Development Notes

### The Nature of Sylvan

Several unique aspects of Sylvan bear investigation:

**Connection to Vows:**
How does the language reflect Fey nature (born from vows and promises)? Possibilities:
- Certain words may be inherently binding when spoken
- The language may resist falsehood
- Making a promise in Sylvan may have magical weight

**Seasonal Variations:**
Do different [Fey Courts](/lore/the-fey-courts) speak different dialects?
- Winter Court Sylvan vs. Summer Court Sylvan?
- Do certain words change meaning or emphasis with the seasons?
- Are there archaic forms used only in formal oaths?

**Relationship to Other Languages:**
- Connection to **[Arcane](/languages/arcane)**? Both are ancient magical languages
- Overlap with **Elvish**? Elves and Fey share the forest
- Do wood elves speak differently than city elves due to Sylvan influence?

## The Singing Pools

The primary known Sylvan phrase names [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/singing-pools):

> **MYLIA-AEW-RUI**
> *Spirit-Water-Song*

This name encapsulates the pools' significance:
- **Spirit** (MYLIA) — Sacred site, spiritually charged
- **Water** (AEW) — The physical element
- **Song** (RUI) — The melodic sounds produced by the waters

The Fey understanding emphasizes the spiritual and experiential qualities, not just the physical description. This reflects how Fey perceive the world—through the lens of promises, vows, and essential nature rather than mere material existence.

## Theoretical Considerations

### Words of Power

Are there words in Sylvan that are themselves binding when spoken?

Fey are born from promises. Their language may reflect this:
- Certain phrases might create magical obligations
- Speaking a vow in Sylvan might be impossible to break
- The language itself might resist deception or falsehood

### True Names

Fey lore often speaks of "true names" having power. In Sylvan:
- Does knowing something's true name in Sylvan grant power over it?
- Are there names that cannot be spoken without consequence?
- How do Fey protect their true names from being known?

### Seasonal Magic

Given the power shifts between Courts with the seasons:
- Do certain words gain or lose power seasonally?
- Are there words that can only be spoken during specific seasons?
- Does the language itself change with the turning of the year?

## Research Directions

Areas requiring further investigation:

1. **Verb forms** — How are actions expressed? Are there verb tenses?
2. **Personal pronouns** — How are "I," "you," "they" expressed?
3. **Negation** — How is negation expressed? Can Fey even speak falsehoods in their native tongue?
4. **Oath-making** — What is the grammatical structure of a binding promise?
5. **Court variations** — How do the Four Courts' dialects differ?
6. **Written forms** — Is Sylvan primarily oral, or are there written texts?

## Notes for Players

As you interact more with Fey creatures and explore the Thornwood, you will encounter more Sylvan. Pay attention to:

- How Fey phrase their promises and oaths
- The names they give to places and things
- The words they refuse to speak or speak only reluctantly
- Seasonal variations in how they speak
- The difference between how they speak in Sylvan vs. Common

Understanding Sylvan may help you:
- Navigate Fey bargains more safely
- Understand the true nature of places and creatures
- Discover what the Fey know about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding)
- Learn whether the Fey can be allies—or must be enemies

Remember: Fey think differently than mortals. Their language reflects this alien perspective.
