# Languages of Westmarch

This section tracks the development of languages used in the campaign. The linguistic systems are currently in early development and will be expanded as the campaign progresses.

---

## Major Languages

### [Arcane](/languages/arcane)

The ancient language used in magical inscriptions, binding rituals, and arcane texts. This is the language inscribed on [the Anchor Stones](/lore/the-anchor-stones) and used in [the original Binding ritual](/lore/the-binding).

**Key Features:**
- Used in formal magical workings
- Found on ancient artifacts and ritual objects
- Precise, structured grammar suited to magical formulas
- May be older than any living language

### [Sylvan](/languages/sylvan)

The language spoken by [the Fey Courts](/lore/the-fey-courts) and creatures of the Thornwood. Connected to the nature of vows and promises that define Fey existence.

**Key Features:**
- Spoken by fey, dryads, and other forest creatures
- Tied to the nature of promises and vows
- May have binding power when certain words are spoken
- Compound words formed by hyphenation

---

## Other Languages

### Common

The everyday language spoken by most humans in Westmarch and the kingdom. Used for commerce, governance, and daily life.

### Elvish

The language of the elves of Westmarch and the Thornwood. Likely has dialectical differences between city elves and wood elves. Relationship to Sylvan is unclear but probable given elves and fey coexist in the forest.

### Draconic

The language of dragons and their servants. Spoken by Verdanthis and the Poison Scale kobolds. Ancient and powerful, potentially related to Arcane.

## Development Status

The campaign's linguistic systems are being developed organically through play. As the party encounters inscriptions, learns words from NPCs, and discovers ancient texts, the vocabulary and grammar of these languages will expand.

Current focus is on **Arcane** and **Sylvan** as these languages are most relevant to understanding [the Binding](/lore/the-binding), [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart), and the Fey.

---

## Cross-Language Relationships

Several intriguing relationships between languages have been noted:

- **Arcane and Sylvan** may share roots—both connected to ancient magic
- **Elvish and Sylvan** likely have significant overlap—elves and fey coexist
- **Draconic** may be older than all others—dragons predate most civilizations
- **Arcane** may be a constructed magical language drawing from multiple sources

---

## Questions Under Investigation

- Did [the Binding ritual](/lore/the-binding) require specific languages? Multiple languages?
- Can Fey be bound by words in their own language?
- What language did the Greenheart "speak" (if any)?
- Are there words of power that work across languages?
- How does the language you use affect the magic you can perform?

## For Players

As you encounter new words, phrases, and grammatical structures in play, they will be documented in the individual language pages. Pay attention to inscriptions, ritual texts, and the speech of ancient or powerful beings—the languages themselves may hold keys to understanding the deeper mysteries of the campaign.
