# Factions

The power structures, organizations, and groups that shape life in Westmarch. Some maintain order, others pursue profit, and a few carry terrible secrets passed down through generations.

---

## Major Factions

### [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)

The ruling noble family and the ducal court. For 300 years, House Westmarch has governed the border city, carrying the burden of terrible knowledge—that Westmarch is not merely a city but the keystone of a magical prison. The family's current crisis mirrors the city's: Duke Aldric withdraws in paranoia while his charismatic brother Brennan gains influence, and none know that the Binding is failing.

**Leadership:** Duke Aldric Westmarch, Duchess Elara, Lord Brennan, Lady Sera

---

### [The Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)

Elite force of approximately 200 warriors who patrol the boundary between Westmarch and the Thornwood. The Rangers swear a sacred dual oath to serve both city and forest, making them uniquely positioned as mediators. Recently, the forest has begun to reject them—Rangers report feeling disconnected, and some have disappeared on deep patrols.

**Leadership:** High Ranger Mira Thornweaver

**Headquarters:** The Greenwatch

---

### [The City Watch](/factions/city-watch)

Westmarch's law enforcement and defense force, approximately 400 strong. The Watch handles everything within the walls—crime, civil disputes, gate security, and city defense. They are practical, overworked, and caught between noble politics and street realities. Recent strange incidents near the western wall have strained resources and morale.

**Leadership:** Captain Garrett Stone, Lieutenant Kessa Ironfoot

**Headquarters:** The Watchtower in Oldtown

---

### [The Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)

Loose organization of druids, nature clerics, and herbalists (30-40 members) who serve as intermediaries between civilization and nature. The Circle predates the Greenwood Pact and carries knowledge—and guilt—passed down through generations. Archdruid Theron Mossbark was present at the Binding 300 years ago and knows the full truth.

**Leadership:** Archdruid Theron Mossbark

**Sacred Sites:** The Grove (just outside the western wall), Oak Father's Grove (in the Temple Quarter)

---

### [The Temples](/factions/the-temples)

Five major religious institutions providing spiritual guidance, healing, education, and social services. The temples work together on matters affecting the city, coordinating aid efforts and presenting unified positions. Recently, they jointly warded the damaged Warren Stone—a temporary containment that buys time but doesn't solve the problem.

**Major Temples:**
- The Platinum Basilica (Bahamut) — Largest temple, provides hospital and orphanage
- The Oak Father's Grove (Silvanus) — Living temple with healing gardens
- The Hall of Law (Erathis) — Courthouse and legal center
- The Wayfarer's Chapel (Avandra) — Serves travelers and refugees
- The Archive of Ioun — Library and research institution

**Notable Leaders:** Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper, High Priest Davian Goldscale, Elder Marissa Chen

---

### [The Merchant's Collective](/factions/merchants-collective)

Voluntary association of merchants, traders, and business operators representing Westmarch's economic interests. The Collective wields considerable political power through economic leverage, control of commerce, and influence over public opinion. They strongly support city expansion and view Pact restrictions as limiting profitable opportunities.

**Leadership:** Speaker Marna Goldleaf (elected)

**Headquarters:** The Exchange in Duke's Bridge

---

### [The Delver's Guild](/factions/delvers-guild)

Organization of approximately 100 adventurers, explorers, and resource gatherers who venture into the Thornwood and Undercroft under license from House Westmarch. Unlike Rangers who serve sacred obligations, Delvers are entrepreneurs who work in the forest for profit. The Guild's relationship with the Rangers is complicated—mutual respect for skills combined with philosophical disagreement about the Pact.

**Leadership:** Guildmaster Torven Blackoak (former Ranger)

**Headquarters:** The Frontier House in the Greenmark

---

### [The Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts)

Organized groups of supernatural beings who inhabit the Thornwood, born from the power of promises and vows. The four seasonal courts (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) operate according to alien logic rooted in oaths and bargains. The Fey were deceived into the Greenwood Pact—they didn't understand they were agreeing to maintain a prison. Now, as the Binding fails, they face the consequences of that ancient choice.

**Notable Fey:** Lady Oona (Archfey of Winter Court), Riven-Vow (Redcap sentinel), Percival (faerie dragon)

**Organization:** Four seasonal courts with shifting power as the year turns
