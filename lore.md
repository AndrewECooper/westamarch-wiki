# Lore

The deep secrets, magical systems, and historical truths underlying the Westmarch campaign. Some of this knowledge is common—taught in schools and told in taverns. Much of it is hidden, known only to a select few who carry terrible burdens of truth.

---

## The Great Secret

Three hundred years ago, the kingdom did not negotiate peace with the forest—it imprisoned a god.

### [The Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart)

A primordial nature spirit—a distributed consciousness existing throughout the entire Thornwood Forest. It is fundamentally a massive mycelial network given sapience, with every tree, plant, and natural creature forming part of its "body." Ancient beyond measure, it predates human civilization by millennia.

**Current State:** Held in magically-induced coma by the Binding. But that prison is failing, and the Greenheart stirs in its sleep.

---

### [The Binding](/lore/the-binding)

The magical prison that holds the Greenheart in forced dormancy. Three hundred years ago, at the end of the Green War, the kingdom achieved victory through overwhelming magical force. The Binding is not a peace treaty—it is a prison maintained by seven Anchor Stones in Westmarch and seven Standing Stones in the Heartwood Sanctuary.

**Current State:** Failing due to natural erosion, accumulated Pact violations, and deliberate sabotage. One stone critically damaged, another being sabotaged, and time is running out.

---

### [The Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact)

The treaty signed 300 years ago that supposedly ended the Green War through mutual agreement. The public story tells of peace and balance between civilization and nature. The truth is darker—the Pact is a lie built on deception, designed to maintain the forced imprisonment of the Greenheart.

**The Deception:** The fey and many others believe they negotiated a treaty of coexistence. They didn't understand they were agreeing to perpetuate a prison.

## The Magical Infrastructure

### [Anchor Stones Overview](/lore/anchor-stones/overview)

Seven worked stones embedded deep in Westmarch's foundations, each roughly 3-4 feet in diameter and inscribed with binding runes. Each stone suppresses a specific aspect of the Greenheart's power by targeting the Place of Power where that aspect manifests.

**The Seven Anchor Stones:**
- [Central Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/central-stone) — Will / Consciousness (beneath the Citadel)
- [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) — Sight / Perception (beneath the Warrens, critically damaged)
- [Archive Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/archive-stone) — Memory / Knowledge (beneath the Archive)
- [Greenwatch Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/greenwatch-stone) — Voice / Command (beneath the Greenwatch)
- [South Market Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/south-market-stone) — Growth / Expansion (beneath a warehouse)
- [Duke's Bridge Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/dukes-bridge-stone) — Hunger / Consumption (beneath a warehouse)
- [Northbank Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/northbank-stone) — Dream / Influence (beneath Lord Brennan's estate, being sabotaged)

### [Places of Power Overview](/lore/places-of-power/overview)

Seven locations in the Thornwood where the Greenheart's aspects manifest most strongly. Each is sympathetically connected to an Anchor Stone, creating the magical circuit that maintains the Binding.

**The Seven Places of Power:**
- [The Heartwood Sanctuary](/lore/places-of-power/heartwood-sanctuary) — The seat of unified consciousness
- [The Singing Pools](/lore/places-of-power/singing-pools) — The Greenheart's eyes and perception
- [The Grandmother's Hollow](/lore/places-of-power/grandmothers-hollow) — Memory and accumulated knowledge
- [The Chorus Grove](/lore/places-of-power/chorus-grove) — Voice and command of forest creatures
- [The Seedmother's Garden](/lore/places-of-power/seedmothers-garden) — Growth and expansion
- [The Maw](/lore/places-of-power/the-maw) — Hunger and consumption
- [The Drowning Glade](/lore/places-of-power/drowning-glade) — Dreams and influence

## The Fey

### [The Fey](/lore/the-fey)

Supernatural beings born from the power of promises and vows. The more universal and deeply felt a promise, the more powerful the resulting fey. Because fey are born from promises, they are fundamentally creatures of obligation—they cannot break oaths lightly, but they excel at following the letter while violating the spirit.

**The Four Courts:** Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Power shifts between them as the year turns—at each equinox and solstice, dominance passes to the appropriate court.

**Relationship to the Binding:** The Fey were deceived into the Greenwood Pact. Many feel betrayed, though they remain bound by their oaths. As the Binding fails, they must decide whether to uphold promises made under false pretenses.

## Knowledge and Understanding

### [Knowledge Tiers](/lore/knowledge-tiers)

A framework for tracking who knows what about the Binding and the conspiracy. Knowledge is power, and secrets are currency in this campaign.

**Tiers:**
- **Tier 0:** Common knowledge—the official history
- **Tier 1:** Educated understanding—scholars and clergy
- **Tier 2:** Specialized knowledge—researchers and ancient texts
- **Tier 3:** Approaching the truth—those who suspect the deception
- **Tier 4:** Full truth—those who know about the Binding
- **Tier 4+:** Conspiracy knowledge—those actively working to free or maintain the prison

---

## Historical Context

The Westmarch campaign is built on layers of history—some remembered, some forgotten, and some deliberately hidden.

**Key Historical Elements:**
- The Green War (300 years ago) — The conflict that ended with the Binding
- The signing of the Greenwood Pact — The treaty built on deception
- Three centuries of maintenance and decay — How the Binding has weakened
- The current conspiracy — Deliberate sabotage accelerating the failure
