# Locations

The places that shape the campaign—from the seven districts of Westmarch to the ancient depths of the Thornwood. This page serves as the main index for all location information.

---

## Westmarch

The border city standing between civilization and the ancient forest. Built on the ruins of a fortress, Westmarch has grown into a city of 22,000 people divided into seven distinct districts. But the city is more than it appears—it is the keystone of a magical prison that has held for 300 years.

## The Thornwood

Ancient, primordial forest stretching west from Westmarch for hundreds of miles. The Thornwood is vast, dangerous, and watchful—home to fey creatures, awakened plants, and secrets buried since before humans came to these lands. The forest IS the Greenheart's body, and as the Binding fails, it stirs with terrible purpose.

### Major Locations

- [The Grove](/locations/thornwood/the-grove) — Sacred clearing just outside Westmarch's western wall where Rangers take their oaths
- [The Green Belt](/locations/thornwood/the-green-belt) — Cleared zone between city walls and deep forest, constantly maintained
- [The Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools) — Fey-touched waters that produce melodic sounds, guarded by Lady Oona
- [Harrow Keep](/locations/thornwood/harrow-keep) — Ruined fortress occupied by Poison Scale kobolds, current location of the Tess-Kydra
- [The Walking Grove](/locations/thornwood/the-walking-grove) — Section of forest that literally moves—trees relocate, paths rearrange
- [The Bone Garden](/locations/thornwood/the-bone-garden) — Clearing filled with bones from the Green War, sacred to multiple fey courts
- [The Heartwood Sanctuary](/locations/thornwood/the-heartwood-sanctuary) — Most concentrated seat of the Greenheart's consciousness, 150 miles west
