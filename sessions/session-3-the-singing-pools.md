# Session 3: The Singing Pools

**Date:** Greenleaf 17th-24th, 1247

## The Guardian's Question

[Riven-Vow](/characters/npcs/riven-vow), the Redcap sentinel, stood between the party and [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools) with a single demand: *"Do you understand the purpose of the stones?"*

The party pieced together what they knew—the inscription from [the Warren Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone), [Elara's](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) translation, [the Archdruid's](/characters/npcs/theron-mossbark) guidance—and answered. The stone's purpose was to suppress vision.

[Riven-Vow](/characters/npcs/riven-vow) accepted their answer. He stepped aside and vanished into the mist.

## The Lady by the Water

As the party explored the Pools, [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) spotted a figure watching them—an elegant fey woman seated on a rock beside one of the pools, her presence cold and still as winter's end.

She did not offer her name and no one asked.

[**Lady Oona**](/characters/npcs/lady-oona) explained that her obligations required her to allow them access to the Pools, but not for free. A price must be paid.

[Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) stepped forward and accepted the burden: a piece of the Sorrow of the Forest. Ancient grief now marks him, making those who serve [Westmarch's](/locations/westmarch) order instinctively distrust his words.

### The Vision

He drank from [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools) and received a vision:

*A circular stone chamber, deep underground. Duke Aldric Westmarch kneels before a great stone covered in arcane glyphs, larger than the one beneath [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens), cracked and flickering with unstable light. He speaks to it, desperate, afraid. He mentions "the South Stone" being lost. He speaks of "[The Great Vow](/lore/the-binding)" and its cost. He is trying to maintain something. He is failing.*

Whether this vision showed past, present, or future, the party cannot say.

## Quill's Burden

[The Lady](/characters/npcs/lady-oona) knew [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill). She knew *what* he was and *why* he suffered.

She would not say who cursed him or the reason. That, she said, would spoil her entertainment. His flailing amused her far too much. Besides, he deserved his fate.

She confirmed she knew about the failing stone in the city and what it meant. She was bound not to speak of it directly, but she offered this: others in [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch) knew the truth. More than one.

The stone's failure, she said, was addressing an imbalance in the bargain.

Then she was gone, leaving the party to gather the Source Stone they needed.

## The Return

The journey back to [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch) was uneventful—three days through [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood), the cart laden with stone from the bottom of the Pools.

**Greenleaf 20th:** The party arrived in [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch) and reported to their respective patrons.

[**Kaelen**](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) shared the vision with [Mira Thornweaver](/characters/npcs/mira-thornweaver). The High Ranger listened, then warned him: the city was already unsettled. Suggesting the Duke might know something about [these stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) could destabilize things further. She advised him to keep the vision quiet and told him to rest. [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) chose to spend a few days at the druid encampment outside the city.

[**Lyrique**](/characters/player-characters/lyrique) reported to [Lord Brennan](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan), who congratulated her on a job well done. He expressed uncertainty whether the vision was fey trickery or truth, but said he would keep an eye on his brother.

[**Quill**](/characters/player-characters/quill) brought word to [Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper), who immediately dove into research on the next problem: how to actually repair and reactivate [the Warren Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone).

## The Problem of Power

**Greenleaf 24th**

After several days of research, [Elara](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) called [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) back to the Archive with troubling news.

The physical repair was possible—skilled craftsmen could mend the stone and re-engrave the runes using the material from [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools). But physical repair alone wouldn't restore the stone's function. It needed to be recharged with magical power. A tremendous amount of it. All at once.

The solution, [Elara](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) explained, was an ancient device called the **Tess-Kydra**, a ritual crucible designed to store magical energy over time and release it in a single surge. With it, even modest casters could eventually accumulate enough power to reactivate [an Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/overview).

The problem: the Tess-Kydra was no longer in [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch).

Historical records showed it had been captured during the Green War—taken when [**Harrow Keep**](/locations/thornwood/harrow-keep), a forward military outpost, fell to the forest's forces. The histories attributed the theft to kobolds serving the green dragon **Verdanthis**, a known agent of [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) during the war.

Whether Verdanthis took the crucible with a specific purpose in mind or simply claimed it as spoils, [Elara](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) cannot say. But the kobolds of the Poison Scale are known to still lair in the ruins of [Harrow Keep](/locations/thornwood/harrow-keep), somewhere in [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood).

The Tess-Kydra might still be there.
