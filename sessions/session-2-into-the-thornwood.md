# Session 2: Into the Thornwood

**Date:** Greenleaf 15th-17th, 1247

## Reporting to the Powers

After discovering [the Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) beneath [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens), the party split to report their findings to their respective patrons.

[**Elara Moonwhisper**](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) was grimly validated—her theories about ancient foundations weren't academic fancy. She coordinated with the temples to establish a temporary ward around the damaged stone, buying time but not solving the problem. She told [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) she believed there might be as many as seven such stones, and that repair would require material from the same source as the original.

[**High Ranger Mira Thornweaver**](/characters/npcs/mira-thornweaver) listened to [Kaelen's](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) report without surprise, then directed the party toward the Archdruid for answers about where to find the needed stone.

[**Lord Brennan Westmarch**](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan) received news of Arissa's death with apparent grief—though whether for a lost ally or a lost opportunity, who can say?

## The Archdruid's Knowledge

The Archdruid, ancient [Theron Mossbark](/characters/npcs/theron-mossbark), examined the inscription from [the stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone): **ZAN-TA KYDRA TESS AQUA MAGI**. [Elara](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) had translated the words: "Suppress it, Stone, Channel to the Water of Vision." [Theron](/characters/npcs/theron-mossbark) recognized the reference—the Water of Vision could only mean [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools), a fey-touched site deep in [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood).

The party was given a cart, two porters, and a mission: retrieve stone from the Pools to repair what had been broken.

## Three Days Into the Forest

Three days into the forest. [The Thornwood](/locations/thornwood) is vast, ancient, and watchful.

On the journey, the party encountered [**Percival**](/characters/npcs/percival), a curious faerie dragon who warned them of a large, ill-tempered bear in their path. They heeded his advice and circled wide, avoiding the creature.

## The Guardian

On the third day, they reached [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools)—a network of clear waters surrounded by unnaturally vibrant growth, where the water itself produces strange, melodic sounds. Beautiful. Sacred. And guarded.

[**Riven-Vow**](/characters/npcs/riven-vow) blocked their path. A Redcap—squat, brutal, his cap stained dark with old blood. He did not attack. Instead, he asked a question:

*"Do you understand the purpose of the stones?"*
