# Session 1: The Gray Morning

**Date:** Greenleaf 14th, 1247

## The Crisis

The city of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch) woke to find thick, unnatural fog rolling out of [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood). It emerged overnight without warning and engulfed the western portion of the city—primarily [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens), the poorest district in the southwest. This was not normal fog. It was gray and cold, clinging to skin like oil, and people reported hearing whispers within it. Visibility dropped to mere feet. Lanterns barely penetrated the murk.

Worse, the fog affected people. Those who stayed in it too long became disoriented, aggressive, or started walking toward the forest as if called. The City Watch was evacuating the fog zone, but hundreds of people were trapped or missing. Something moved in the gray—shapes that didn't look quite human, sounds that didn't match any known creature.

The fog wasn't dissipating. If anything, it was slowly spreading. What began in [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) was now creeping into the edges of Duke's Bridge and threatening to engulf more of the city. The western wall—where the fog was thickest—had become a place of nightmares. Guards reported seeing figures in the mist, hearing voices of the dead, and feeling watched by something vast and hostile.

[Captain Garrett Stone](/characters/npcs/captain-garrett-stone) had cordoned off the worst areas, but people needed help: trapped families, injured refugees, and those who ventured into the fog and hadn't returned. The Duke had called for capable people to assist. [The Rangers](/factions/rangers-of-the-green) were investigating the fog's source. The druids were conducting emergency rituals. And everyone was asking the same question: Why now? What caused this?

## The Four

Four individuals found themselves drawn into the crisis engulfing [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens), each arriving by different paths:

[**Lyrique**](/characters/player-characters/lyrique) was sent by [Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan) to retrieve Councilor Arissa—a political ally trapped by the fog. [**Sammael**](/characters/player-characters/sammael) was assigned as her guide, his knowledge of the Warrens' twisting streets invaluable in the murk.

Meanwhile, [**Kaelen Vale**](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) received orders from High Ranger [Mira Thornweaver](/characters/npcs/mira-thornweaver) to scout the fog's nature, while [**Quill**](/characters/player-characters/quill) was dispatched by Chief Archivist [Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) to investigate what she believed was a connection to the city's ancient foundations.

## Convergence

The four converged after [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) and [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) fought off an Awakened Shrub that had burst through the cobblestones—a creature of root and thorn that had no business being inside city walls. Together, they made their way to the Wayfarers' Hall, only to find it locked, silent, and dark.

Inside, devastation. Bodies lay battered amid the wreckage. [Elder Marissa Chen](/characters/npcs/elder-marissa-chen), the refugee community's leader, was found unconscious but alive. When revived, she spoke of something emerging from the sealed door to [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft)—something from the mist that killed without mercy. She believed it had taken Councilor Arissa back the way it came.

## Into the Depths

The party descended into the flooded, crumbling tunnels beneath [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens). They found Arissa's corpse—bludgeoned, broken—before the thing that killed her found them: a creature of living fog, cold and violent. The fight was brutal, but they prevailed.

## The Warren Stone

Pressing deeper, they discovered the source: a great stone embedded in the bedrock, covered in arcane script, cracked and flickering with unstable light. Tool marks scarred its surface. Someone had damaged this deliberately. [Quill's](/characters/player-characters/quill) curse stirred painfully in its presence—thorns and shadows manifesting unbidden.

The party documented what they could and retreated to report their findings.
