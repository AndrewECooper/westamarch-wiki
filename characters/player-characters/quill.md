# Quill

**Class:** Wizard
**Heritage:** Fey (Sprite)
**Level:** 3

---

## Overview

Quill is a fey archivist suffering from a powerful curse that periodically erases his memories. Every few years, he awakens with no recollection of his past, finding only a letter from his former self explaining his circumstances. His most recent awakening occurred approximately two years ago.

Despite this affliction, Quill has rebuilt a life in Westmarch as a chronicler for the Archive of Ioun, serving as assistant to Chief Archivist [Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper). His fey nature and fragmented connection to the Thornwood make him uniquely suited to investigating the current crisis threatening the city.

## The Curse

### The Memory Wipe

On the anniversary of some unknown event, Quill's memories reset completely. Each cycle, he loses more of his original self—manifested physically as his once-silver hair turning progressively crimson. Now only a single streak of silver remains.

Before each reset, Quill writes a letter to his future self, leaving instructions, maps, and notes about important people and places. This letter is his only connection to who he was.

### The Accursed Manifestation

Quill's curse has a secondary effect tied to moments of social failure. Whenever he fails a Deception or Persuasion check, the curse manifests visibly in one of two ways:

* **Black Thorns:** Sharp, dark thorns painfully erupt from his skin, tearing through clothing. Their aggressive, unnatural growth causes others to recoil in fear.

* **Shadow Form:** Cold air swirls around him as his shadow grows and stretches into the vague form of a towering, multi-limbed, vine-covered figure.

When this occurs, the failed check is ignored and Quill immediately rolls an Intimidation check (with expertise) instead. Even success may not produce the intended result—creatures may recoil in fear and distrust rather than be persuaded.

## Relationships

### Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper

Quill's employer, mentor, and protector. When Quill awakened from his last memory wipe, Elara took him in, gave him shelter, work, and purpose. She is endlessly curious and genuinely kind. Without her intervention, Quill might not have survived those first confused months. He owes her everything he currently has.

See: [Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper)

### Lady Sera Westmarch

The Duke's daughter and heir, age 26. Quill and Sera study magic together, an arrangement that likely began through Elara's connections to the nobility. They share a scholarly bond—two students of the arcane learning alongside each other. Sera is intelligent and curious, though sheltered from the darker truths of her family's legacy.

See: [Lady Sera](/characters/npcs/lady-sera)

### Lyrique

An elven bard and friend. Quill met [Lyrique](/characters/player-characters/lyrique) through Elara Moonwhisper, where they were both students. Their friendship is genuine, built on shared wit and mutual curiosity. Lyrique moves in political spheres that Quill observes but doesn't fully understand.

### Kaelen Vale

A half-elf Ranger of the Green. Quill's connection to [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) is more recent, forged through their shared investigation of the Gray Morning crisis. Kaelen represents the bridge between city and forest—something Quill, as a fey living in Westmarch, understands instinctively.

### Sammael

A human rogue and private investigator from the Warrens. Quill met [Sammael](/characters/player-characters/sammael) during the Gray Morning crisis. They work well together despite their different backgrounds.

### Guildmaster Torven Blackoak

Leader of the Delver's Guild and a former Ranger. Quill knows of [Torven](/characters/npcs/torven-blackoak) through his work at the Archive—the Guildmaster occasionally seeks information about the Thornwood or its dangers. Their relationship is professional, perhaps slightly wary. Torven is pragmatic and profit-driven; Quill is scholarly and cautious.

### Duke Aldric Westmarch

The city's ruler. Quill knows [the Duke](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric) only by reputation and the necessity of recognizing his authority. Failure to show proper deference to House Westmarch could have consequences.

### Duchess Elara Westmarch

The Duke's wife. Like the Duke, Quill knows [her](/characters/npcs/duchess-elara) primarily as a figure of authority to be recognized and respected.

## Current Knowledge

### The Gray Morning Investigation

Quill was dispatched by Elara to investigate the unnatural fog that engulfed the Warrens. What he discovered has confirmed Elara's long-dismissed theories:

**The Warren Anchor Stone:**

* A large stone embedded in the bedrock beneath the Warrens, covered in arcane script
* Cracked, flickering with unstable energy, and marked with deliberate tool marks—sabotage
* The inscription reads: *ZAN-TA KYDRA TESS AQUA MAGI*
* Translation: "Suppress it, Stone, Channel to the Water of Vision"
* Quill's curse reacted violently in its presence (thorns and shadows manifesting)
* Currently warded by the temples (temporary containment)

See: [The Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone)

**Elara's Research:**

* There may be as many as seven such stones in or around Westmarch
* The stones are connected to the city's ancient foundations and [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact)
* Repairing the damaged stone requires Source Stone from [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/singing-pools) (retrieved) and the Tess-Kydra (not yet retrieved)
* The Tess-Kydra was stolen during the Green War and is likely at Harrow Keep, guarded by kobolds

See: [Anchor Stones Overview](/lore/anchor-stones/overview)

**The Singing Pools:**

* Quill traveled with the party to retrieve Source Stone
* Lady Oona (a fey of the Winter Court) knew who Quill was and why he was cursed
* She would not reveal the details, saying his suffering amused her and he deserved his fate

## The Letter

*The following is the letter Quill found upon his most recent awakening, approximately two years ago:*

> Dear Quill,
>
> Perhaps you were not expecting this letter. It is, after all, received in quite the unfamiliar fashion.
>
> Hopefully, this letter finds your turn-of-the-year to be comfortable. I'm sure Madam Moonwhisper has either prepared for the receival of this missive…or perhaps been rather enamoured with a new tome of some kind. A bit on the finicky side, she is, yet a blessing and a kindness nonetheless.
>
> As you're reading this, I can only hope that some form of recognition might descend from the depths of your memory, though I fear no such hope is possible. Post reading this, I recommend finding a still pool or perhaps a mirror. Regard your appearance firstly. You will notice that your once silver hair has turned quite crimson. At the time this was written, little more than a stripe or two remained. Now, I can only imagine that you've but a single streak of silver left. Take note with your emerald eyes, Quill, this appearance shift is the result of some magick that has afflicted you for well over a century and yet continues still.
>
> This magick, this curse, it is a potent thing. As such, I believe you will not recognize your surroundings. That is the purpose of this letter. To remind you of what you've forgotten.
>
> Firstly, you are Chronicler Quill, an archivist within the Archive of Ioun in the city of Westmarch. You have resided in Westmarch for the better part of three centuries. You came to reside within the city after the events that resulted in the Greenwood Pact. If this does not sound familiar to you, I suggest reading the tomes and journals that can be found beneath the resting place of this letter.
>
> As an archivist of the Archives, you work under the Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper. Madam Moonwhisper will likely be nearby, in preparation for your awakening. She is a kindness and curiosity both. Had it not been for her intervention, you likely would not have made it to the turn-of-the-year, let alone have a place to rest your head or a plate to eat. Listen to her words and follow her instructions.
>
> Much has changed since you were last awake. The settling has become a city and the forest has grown and died and continued hence. You will be lost. Perhaps you will be scared. Have no fear, Quill. You have gone through this before and you will persist hence.
>
> Attached, you'll find short notes about many of the people you interact with on a normal basis. You will also find, not far from where you awoke, a tattered and beaten leather-bound book. This is your spellbook. A tome for which you have gathered knowledge throughout many an age. Familiarize yourself with its contents, remember the knowledge you've so far gleaned, endeavor to conquer this dark magick that envelopes your natural clock.
>
> Persevere, Quill.
>
> Eternally, Your deepest conspirator and closest confidant
