# Sammael

**Class:** Rogue
**Heritage:** Human
**Level:** 3

---

## Overview

Sammael is a private investigator who works the streets of the Warrens—finding lost people, tracking unfaithful spouses, and knowing the kind of people most citizens pretend don't exist. He's a regular contractor for the City Watch, useful for jobs that require discretion or access to places guardsmen can't easily go.

When the Gray Morning fog engulfed his home district, Sammael was pulled into something far larger than a missing persons case.

---

## Background

Sammael grew up in the Warrens and never left. He knows its twisting streets, its desperate residents, and its unwritten rules better than anyone. At some point, he turned that knowledge into a trade—finding people who didn't want to be found, uncovering secrets for those willing to pay.

The City Watch finds him useful. He finds their coin useful. It's a practical arrangement.

## Relationships

### The City Watch

Sammael works as a regular contractor for the Watch, handling jobs that benefit from a lighter touch than armored guardsmen can provide. [Captain Stone's](/characters/npcs/captain-garrett-stone) people know him. Whether they trust him is another matter.

### Lord Brennan Westmarch

Sammael was hired at [Lord Brennan's](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan) request to guide Lyrique into the fog-choked Warrens. He doesn't work for Brennan directly—the job came through the Watch—but the Lord's influence put him on this path. What that means going forward remains to be seen.

### The Warrens

This is Sammael's home. The refugees at the Wayfarers' Hall, the laborers in Newtown, the people scraping by in narrow streets—these are the people he knows. When the fog rolled in and bodies started appearing, it stopped being just a job.

### Quill

A fey wizard from the Archive. An unlikely companion, but [Quill's](/characters/player-characters/quill) knowledge and magic have proven useful. They work well together despite their different backgrounds.

### Kaelen Vale

A Ranger who knows the forest like Sammael knows the streets. [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) is competent and reliable—the kind of person you want watching your back.

### Lyrique

The bard he was hired to escort into the Warrens. [Lyrique](/characters/player-characters/lyrique) moves in circles far above Sammael's station, but she's proven capable when things get dangerous.

## Current Situation

What began as a simple escort mission became something else entirely. Sammael watched Councilor Arissa pulled dead from the Undercroft. He saw the sabotaged Anchor Stone flickering in the dark beneath his own neighborhood. He fought a creature of living fog in tunnels he's walked a hundred times.

Now he's traveled deep into the Thornwood, faced down fey guardians, and retrieved magical stones from enchanted pools. The Warrens are still in danger—the ward on that stone is temporary—and the next step is retrieving something called the Tess-Kydra from a kobold-infested ruin called Harrow Keep.

Sammael didn't sign up for any of this. But the Warrens are his home, and he's not going to let them fall.
