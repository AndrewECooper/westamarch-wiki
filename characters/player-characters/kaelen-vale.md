# Kaelen Vale

**Class:** Ranger
**Heritage:** Half-Elf
**Level:** 3

---

## Overview

Kaelen Vale is a Ranger of the Green, sworn to the dual oath that binds him to serve both Westmarch and the Thornwood. Born to a human carpenter and a wandering druid, he has spent his life with one foot in each world—and now finds himself standing guard as the ancient peace between them begins to fray.

---

## Background

### Family

**Darmon Vale** (Father) — A former soldier of Westmarch who laid down his sword to become a carpenter. He raised Kaelen in the city, teaching him hard work, practicality, and the value of protecting one's community.

**Aeris Willowstep** (Mother) — A wandering druid of the Thornwood, a quiet guardian of ancient groves and fey glens. Though never married to Darmon, she and Kaelen's father shared a deep mutual respect. Under her guidance, Kaelen learned the whispers of the leaves, the sacred rites of the forest, and the complex nature of the fey.

### The Ranger's Path

When he came of age, Kaelen pledged himself to the Rangers of the Green. His mixed heritage made him a natural fit for the dual oath—serve the city and the forest alike. He quickly earned a reputation as a confident survivalist who trusts his instincts over bureaucracy. He respects authority, but only when it deserves respect.

## Relationships

### High Ranger Mira Thornweaver

Kaelen's commanding officer and a woman he deeply trusts. Recently, even she seems troubled by secrets she won't speak aloud. When Kaelen reported the sabotaged Anchor Stone and the vision of the Duke, she listened without surprise—and directed him toward the Archdruid rather than offering answers herself. She advised him to keep the vision quiet to avoid destabilizing the city.

### Aeris Willowstep

His mother remains somewhere in the Thornwood, tending to her groves. Their relationship is loving but distant—she walks her path, he walks his. Her teachings shaped who he became.

### Darmon Vale

His father still lives in Westmarch, still works with his hands. Kaelen visits when duty allows. Darmon is proud of his son but worries about the dangers he faces.

### Quill

A fey wizard working at the Archive. Kaelen met [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) during the Gray Morning crisis and they've worked well together since. Quill's fey nature gives him a perspective on the forest that Kaelen finds valuable.

### Lyrique

An elven bard who moves in political circles. Kaelen met [Lyrique](/characters/player-characters/lyrique) during the Gray Morning crisis. She's charming and capable, though Kaelen doesn't fully understand her world of noble intrigue.

### Sammael

A human rogue from the Warrens. Practical and street-smart, [Sammael](/characters/player-characters/sammael) knows the city's underbelly the way Kaelen knows the forest. They complement each other well.

## Current Situation

### The Sorrow of the Forest

At the Singing Pools, Kaelen accepted a burden from Lady Oona: a piece of the Sorrow of the Forest. Ancient grief now marks him, making those who serve Westmarch's order instinctively distrust his words.

**Mechanical Effect:** Disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) checks against City Watch, Citadel officials, and clergy of Erathis or Bahamut.

### The Vision of Duke Aldric

Kaelen drank from the Singing Pools and received a vision:

> *A circular stone chamber, deep underground. Duke Aldric Westmarch kneels before a great stone covered in arcane glyphs—larger than the one beneath the Warrens, cracked and flickering with unstable light. He speaks to it, desperate, afraid. He mentions "the South Stone" being lost. He speaks of "The Great Vow" and its cost. He is trying to maintain something. He is failing.*

Whether this vision showed past, present, or future, Kaelen cannot say. He shared it with Mira, who advised him to keep it quiet. He also shared it with the rest of the party.

### Current Mission

Kaelen has been working with the party to address the crisis. They've retrieved Source Stone from [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/singing-pools) and learned that the Tess-Kydra is needed to complete the repair. The crucible is likely at Harrow Keep, guarded by kobolds.

## Open Questions

* Does Aeris know what is happening in the Thornwood? Has she sensed [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) stirring?
* How will Kaelen reconcile his dual oath if forced to choose between city and forest?
* What did High Ranger Mira choose not to tell him about the Anchor Stones?
* How will the Sorrow curse affect his interactions with authorities going forward?
