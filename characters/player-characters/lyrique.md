# Lyrique

**Class:** Bard
**Heritage:** Elf
**Level:** 3

---

## Overview

Lyrique is an elven bard with a fascination for people and their stories. Raised in sheltered privilege but drawn to the wider world, she has become an observer of life in all its forms—and a willing agent for Lord Brennan Westmarch, whose vision for the city's future she finds compelling. She doesn't yet understand how complicated that loyalty may become.

---

## Background

### A Sheltered Youth

Lyrique was born to older elven parents—courtiers who had her late in life and largely delegated her upbringing to tutors and schools. She grew up in the noble wards of Westmarch, surrounded by privilege but starved for attention. Her parents were present in name but absent in practice.

Left to her own devices, Lyrique became an observer. She learned to sneak, to watch, to listen at doors and around corners. The lives of servants, merchants, and common folk fascinated her far more than the stiff formality of noble society.

### Elara's Student

At some point, Lyrique came under the tutelage of Chief Archivist [Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper)—likely arranged by her parents as appropriate education for a young noblewoman. Under Elara's guidance, Lyrique honed her talents with music and story. She proved proficient with many instruments and discovered a gift for weaving tales, often embellishing the mundane into the legendary.

It was through Elara that Lyrique met Quill. She became immediately fascinated by his curse and his fragmented existence. They became friends, and Lyrique has since told many stories of their adventures together—some true, some considerably embellished.

### Lord Brennan's Agent

Living in the noble wards gave Lyrique access to [Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan). She was drawn to him—his charisma, his vision for a better Westmarch, his willingness to challenge the status quo. He was handsome and idealistic, everything the stagnant nobility around her was not.

Lyrique became his eyes and ears. She gathers gossip, observes the movements of notable figures, and reports back information pertinent to his cause. She does this willingly, believing in what he represents. She doesn't understand the true nature of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), so his positions on expansion and modernization seem reasonable—even noble.

She has no idea what Brennan truly is.

## Relationships

### Lord Brennan Westmarch

Lyrique admires Brennan and serves as one of his informants. She believes in his vision for Westmarch's future and finds his willingness to challenge tradition refreshing. Her loyalty to him is genuine, built on admiration rather than obligation. She does not know the depth of his involvement in the current crisis.

**What Brennan Knows Through Lyrique:**

* Everything the party has discovered
* The vision of [Duke Aldric](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric) with the Anchor Stone
* [Elara's](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) research into the Tess-Kydra and Harrow Keep
* The party's plans and capabilities

See: [Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan)

### Quill

Her closest friend. They met as students under Elara Moonwhisper, and Lyrique has been fascinated by [Quill's](/characters/player-characters/quill) curse ever since. She tells stories about their time together—adventures both real and invented—and genuinely cares about his well-being. Their friendship is one of the few relationships in her life built on mutual affection rather than utility.

### Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper

Lyrique's former tutor. Their relationship has likely shifted from teacher-student to something more collegial, though Elara may still see her as a promising young woman who hasn't quite found her purpose. Lyrique respects Elara but has moved beyond the Archive's walls.

### Her Parents

Distant. They provided for her material needs but little else. Lyrique doesn't resent them, exactly—she simply doesn't think about them much. They are background figures in a life she has built for herself.

### Kaelen Vale

A Ranger she met during the Gray Morning crisis. [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) is capable and grounded—very different from the nobles she's accustomed to. She respects his skills even if she doesn't fully understand his world.

### Sammael

The investigator assigned to guide her into the Warrens. [Sammael](/characters/player-characters/sammael) knows a side of Westmarch she's only observed from a distance. Their partnership has proven effective.

## Current Situation

Lord Brennan sent Lyrique into the fog-choked Warrens to retrieve Councilor Arissa, a political ally. The mission was meant to demonstrate competence where the Duke showed only paranoia—a political win for Brennan's faction.

It went wrong. Arissa was already dead when they found her, killed by something that emerged from beneath the city. Lyrique saw the sabotaged [Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone), fought a creature of living fog, and walked out of the Undercroft with more questions than answers.

She traveled deep into the Thornwood with Quill, Kaelen, and Sammael, seeking stone to repair what was broken. She reported everything to Brennan—the vision, the fey encounter, Elara's research—and received his apparent concern in return.

Now the party prepares to retrieve the Tess-Kydra from Harrow Keep. Lyrique continues to serve Brennan, unaware that every report she makes feeds information to the conspiracy threatening everything she thinks she's protecting.
