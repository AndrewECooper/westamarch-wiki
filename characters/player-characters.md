# Player Characters

Four strangers, drawn together by crisis. When the Gray Morning fog engulfed the Warrens on Greenleaf 14th, 1247, these four converged to face a threat that would reveal truths hidden for three centuries.

## The Party

### [Kaelen Vale](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale)

**Class:** Ranger | **Heritage:** Half-Elf | **Level:** 3

A Ranger of the Green, sworn to the dual oath that binds him to serve both Westmarch and the Thornwood. Born to a human carpenter and a wandering druid, Kaelen walks the boundary between civilization and wilderness. Recently, he drank from the Singing Pools and received a vision of Duke Aldric kneeling before a great stone, desperate and afraid. He now carries the Sorrow of the Forest—a curse that makes those who serve Westmarch's order instinctively distrust his words.

**Key Relationships:** High Ranger Mira Thornweaver (commanding officer), Aeris Willowstep (mother), Darmon Vale (father)

**Current Mission:** Working with the party to repair the Warren Anchor Stone and prevent the Binding's collapse

### [Lyrique](/characters/player-characters/lyrique)

**Class:** Bard | **Heritage:** Elf | **Level:** 3

An elven bard with a fascination for people and their stories. Raised in sheltered privilege but drawn to the wider world, Lyrique has become an observer of life in all its forms—and a willing agent for Lord Brennan Westmarch, whose vision for the city's future she finds compelling. She doesn't yet understand how complicated that loyalty may become.

**Key Relationships:** Lord Brennan Westmarch (patron), Quill (closest friend), Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper (former tutor)

**Current Mission:** Serving as Lord Brennan's eyes and ears while working with the party—unaware that every report she makes feeds information to the conspiracy threatening everything

---

### [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill)

**Class:** Wizard | **Heritage:** Fey (Sprite) | **Level:** 3

A fey archivist suffering from a powerful curse that periodically erases his memories. Every few years, he awakens with no recollection of his past, finding only a letter from his former self explaining his circumstances. Despite this affliction, Quill has rebuilt a life in Westmarch as a chronicler for the Archive of Ioun. His fey nature and connection to the curse make him uniquely tied to the unfolding crisis.

**Key Relationships:** Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper (employer and protector), Lady Sera Westmarch (study partner), Lyrique (closest friend)

**Current Situation:** Lady Oona revealed she knows who Quill is and why he was cursed, but refused to explain, saying his suffering amused her and he deserved his fate. His curse reacts violently to the Anchor Stones.

---

### [Sammael](/characters/player-characters/sammael)

**Class:** Rogue | **Heritage:** Human | **Level:** 3

A private investigator who works the streets of the Warrens—finding lost people, tracking unfaithful spouses, and knowing the kind of people most citizens pretend don't exist. A regular contractor for the City Watch, Sammael knows the Warrens better than anyone. When the Gray Morning fog engulfed his home district, he was pulled into something far larger than a missing persons case.

**Key Relationships:** The City Watch (regular contractor), Lord Brennan Westmarch (indirect—hired through the Watch), the people of the Warrens

**Current Mission:** The Warrens are his home. The ward on that stone is temporary. He's not going to let them fall.

## Party Formation

The four converged during the Gray Morning crisis on Greenleaf 14th:

- **Lyrique** was sent by Lord Brennan to retrieve Councilor Arissa, with **Sammael** as her guide
- **Kaelen** received orders from High Ranger Mira to scout the fog's nature
- **Quill** was dispatched by Chief Archivist Elara to investigate the city's ancient foundations

They found each other, discovered the sabotaged Warren Anchor Stone, and have been working together ever since to unravel the conspiracy threatening Westmarch.
