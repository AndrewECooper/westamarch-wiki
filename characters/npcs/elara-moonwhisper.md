# Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper

## Role
Leader of the [Archive of Ioun](/locations/westmarch/archive-of-ioun)

## Race and Age
High Elf Wizard, 312 years old

## Location
[The Archive of Ioun](/locations/westmarch/archive-of-ioun), Temple Quarter

## Description
Believes ancient legends are true and is excited when someone listens. She has been frantically pulling old texts about the Green War and [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), insisting the ancient legends are literal truth. Most dismiss her as an obsessive scholar, but she's desperate for someone to take her seriously.

## What She Knows
**[Tier 3, approaching Tier 4](/lore/knowledge-tiers) through research**: She has found references to:
- [The Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart)
- [The Binding](/lore/the-binding)
- The Seven Stones ([Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview))
- She knows the Archive basement contains an Anchor Stone and suspects it's crucial
- She doesn't know the full operational truth but is piecing it together

## Current State
Validated by the party's discoveries. She coordinated with the temples to ward the damaged Warren Stone and has been researching how to repair it. She discovered the Tess-Kydra's existence and its likely location at Harrow Keep.

Her research has intensified since adventurers began bringing her evidence that confirms her theories. She is no longer dismissed as an obsessive scholar—at least not by those who have seen the truth firsthand.

## Motivation
Uncover the truth, preserve knowledge, save the city through understanding.

## Connections and Relationships
- **Faction**: Leader of the [Archive of Ioun](/locations/westmarch/archive-of-ioun), part of [the Temples](/factions/the-temples)
- **Faith**: Devoted to Ioun, goddess of knowledge
- **Employer**: [Quill's](/characters/player-characters/quill) employer and mentor
- **Former Student**: Former tutor to [Lyrique](/characters/player-characters/lyrique)
- **Scholarly Connection**: Connected to [Lady Sera Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lady-sera) through scholarly circles; arranged for Sera to study magic with Quill
- **Temple Network**: Coordinates with other temples, including [High Priest Davian Goldscale](/characters/npcs/davian-goldscale)

## The Archive's Secret
Elara knows something most citizens don't: deep in the Archive's basement lies one of the seven Anchor Stones. She has suspected for years that it serves a purpose far more important than most realize, and her recent research has confirmed those suspicions.

## Recent Discoveries
Elara's research has uncovered:
- The existence of the **Tess-Kydra**, an ancient crucible capable of repairing or destroying Anchor Stones
- Its likely location at Harrow Keep
- Methods for warding damaged Anchor Stones (which she used to help protect the Warren Stone)
- Connections between the Seven Stones and the Binding that imprisoned the Greenheart
- Evidence that the ancient legends about the Green War are not myths but literal history

## From Dismissed to Validated
For years, most people dismissed Elara as an obsessive scholar chasing legends. The discovery of sabotaged Anchor Stones and encounters with supernatural threats from the Thornwood have validated everything she tried to warn people about. She now works frantically to research solutions before the Binding fails completely.

## Mentor and Employer
Elara has taken on several promising students and employees over her centuries of service, including:
- [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill), whom she employs at the Archive
- [Lyrique](/characters/player-characters/lyrique), whom she tutored in the past
- Through her scholarly networks, she facilitated [Lady Sera Westmarch's](/characters/npcs/lady-sera) magical education

## The Weight of Knowledge
As a 312-year-old elf, Elara has access to records and memories that span centuries. She has pieced together truths that others thought lost to time, and she understands that knowledge—properly applied—may be the key to saving Westmarch from the consequences of a 300-year-old deception.
