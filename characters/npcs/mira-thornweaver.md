# High Ranger Mira Thornweaver

## Role
Commander of the [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)

## Race and Age
Half-elf, 67 years old

## Location
The Greenwatch, Greenmark

## Description
Mira has served for over forty years and knows the Thornwood better than anyone alive. Lately, she seems troubled—Rangers report she spends long hours alone in her office, and some say they've seen her staring at the forest with an expression of deep worry.

## What She Knows
**[Tier 4 knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers) (partial)**: She was told when she took the position: "This stone maintains the Pact, protect it at all costs." She suspects there's much more she wasn't told. She knows:
- The forest has been "wrong" for months
- Rangers have gone missing
- Creatures are more aggressive than usual
- The [Northeast Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) requires protection and monthly checks
- Something systemic is failing, though she doesn't fully understand what

## Current State
Deeply conflicted. She senses systemic failure but doesn't fully understand it. When [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen) reported the sabotaged stone and the vision of the Duke, she wasn't surprised—but she advised him to keep it quiet to avoid destabilizing the city.

She checks the Northeast Anchor Stone monthly and has noticed troubling signs, but lacks the full context to understand what's truly happening.

## Motivation
Protect the Rangers, maintain the balance, discover the truth without causing panic.

## Connections and Relationships
- **Faction**: Commander of the [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)
- **Responsibility**: Guards the Northeast Anchor Stone
- **Reports to**: Technically serves both [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch) and the [Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood) due to the Rangers' dual oath
- **Recent Contact**: Has received concerning reports from [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen) about sabotaged stones and visions

## Four Decades of Service
Mira has dedicated her life to the Rangers of the Green, walking the boundary between civilization and wilderness. She has seen patterns and changes in the Thornwood that few others could recognize, and her current worry stems from decades of experience telling her something is deeply, fundamentally wrong.

## The Weight of Partial Knowledge
Mira occupies a difficult position—she knows enough to understand the stakes are higher than most people realize, but not enough to fully understand what's happening or how to stop it. She must balance her duty to protect the city with her suspicion that those in power aren't telling her everything she needs to know.
