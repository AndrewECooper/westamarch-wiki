# Duke Aldric Westmarch

## Role
Ruler of Westmarch

## Race and Age
Human, 52 years old

## Location
[The Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)

## Description
Once vigorous and engaged, Aldric has become increasingly withdrawn over the past year. He seems paranoid, holds fewer public audiences, and spends time alone in the Citadel's deep vaults. Court officials whisper concerns about his health and judgment.

## What He Knows
**[Tier 4 knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers)**: He knows the full truth about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding), the [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview), and Westmarch's role as a prison. He has discovered the Binding is failing faster than it should but doesn't know about the conspiracy or his brother's involvement.

## Current State
Terrified and isolated. He checks the Central Anchor Stone obsessively, trying to maintain it with limited resources. He trusts almost no one and doesn't know who to turn to.

## Motivation
Protect the city and his family. Keep the Binding intact until his daughter [Sera](/characters/npcs/lady-sera) is ready to inherit the burden.

## Connections and Relationships
- **Wife**: [Duchess Elara Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duchess-elara)
- **Daughter**: [Lady Sera Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lady-sera) (heir, not yet told the family secrets)
- **Brother**: [Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan) (unaware of Brennan's betrayal)
- **Faction**: [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)

## Family Legacy
Duke Aldric is the current bearer of a three-hundred-year-old secret passed down through House Westmarch since the signing of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact). His ancestor, Duke Garrick Westmarch, was one of the architects of the deception that ended the Green War—and Aldric now carries the burden of maintaining that prison.
