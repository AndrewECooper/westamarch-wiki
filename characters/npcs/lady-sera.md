# Lady Sera Westmarch

## Role
Duke's daughter and heir

## Race and Age
Human, 26 years old

## Location
[The Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)

## Description
Intelligent and curious, Sera studies magic and history. She is sheltered from the darker truths of her family's legacy and seems unaware of the full tensions in her family.

## What She Knows
**[Tier 2 knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers) at most**: She has not been told the family secrets about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) or the true nature of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact). Her father intends to tell her eventually but doesn't believe she's ready.

## Current State
Pursuing her studies in magic and history, unaware of the burden she will eventually inherit. She continues her scholarly pursuits and court duties as heir to House Westmarch.

## Motivation
Learn, grow, eventually lead. She doesn't yet understand what that will require or what terrible knowledge comes with ruling Westmarch.

## Education
Lady Sera has received extensive education befitting an heir to House Westmarch, with particular focus on magic and history. Her current magical studies represent her personal interests and may eventually serve her role as future ruler.

## The Burden Yet to Come
As heir to House Westmarch, Sera will one day need to learn the truth about what her family truly guards—but for now, her father keeps her in the dark, perhaps hoping to give her a few more years of peace before she must shoulder that terrible knowledge.
