Lieutenant Ironfoot believes in strict adherence to law and protocol. She views justice as absolute and approaches her duties with the discipline expected of both a dwarf and a follower of Bahamut. Her troops respect her fairness—she holds everyone to the same high standard, including herself.

## Temple Relations
As the Watch's primary liaison to the temples, Kessa manages the complex relationship between secular law enforcement and religious institutions. She coordinates on matters of sanctuary law, temple security, and cases involving religious disputes.

## By the Book
Kessa's insistence on proper procedure sometimes frustrates those who want quick results, but her approach has prevented numerous legal complications and maintains the Watch's reputation for fairness. In a city where noble politics often interfere with justice, her unwavering adherence to protocol provides stability.
