# Commander Edric Harrow

**Role:** Commander of Harrow Keep (deceased)
**Race/Age:** Human, died 952 (age unknown)
**Historical Period:** The Green War (920-940)

## Description

A veteran decorated for valor who was selected to build and command Harrow Keep during the Green War. Known for his methodical leadership and genuine concern for his soldiers, Harrow was respected not just as a commander but as a leader who shared his men's burdens.

He walked the walls each night, joined patrols monthly despite his rank, and wrote extensively about the nature of the forest. His journals reveal a man who understood that the [Thornwood](/locations/thornwood) was not simply an enemy to be conquered, but a living force that demanded respect.

## Notable Quote

> *"The forest does not sleep. It watches. It waits. It remembers every tree we fell and every path we cut. We hold this ground not because we have conquered it, but because it has not yet decided to take it back."*

This quote, found in his personal journals, captures Harrow's understanding of the true nature of the conflict.

## Historical Role

**Built and commanded Harrow Keep** from its founding until its evacuation in 934. The keep served as a forward military outpost deep in the Thornwood, holding the line against the forest's supernatural forces during the darkest years of the war.

Under his command:
- Harrow Keep held against repeated assaults
- Soldiers learned to respect the forest as well as fight it
- Extensive records were kept of forest patterns and supernatural phenomena
- An orderly evacuation was conducted when the position became untenable

## Fate

Oversaw the evacuation of Harrow Keep in 934, ensuring his soldiers withdrew safely rather than dying in a doomed last stand. Returned to Westmarch and continued to serve with distinction until the war's end in 940.

**Died in 952**, twelve years after [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) was signed, and was buried with full military honors. He lived long enough to see the peace he fought for, though whether he knew the full truth about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) is unclear.

## Legacy

- [Harrow Keep](/locations/thornwood/harrow-keep) bears his name
- His journals provide some of the most detailed observations of the Thornwood during the war
- Remembered as a commander who valued his soldiers' lives
- His pragmatic understanding of the forest influenced later Ranger doctrine

## Connections

- Commanded [Harrow Keep](/locations/thornwood/harrow-keep) during the Green War
- Served under [Duke Garrick Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-garrick-westmarch)
- His writings may have influenced [Archdruid Theron Mossbark](/characters/npcs/archdruid-theron-mossbark) and others who remember the war
- The keep he commanded now houses the Poison Scale kobolds and the stolen Tess-Kydra

## Current Relevance

Though long dead, Commander Harrow's legacy remains relevant. The keep he built now plays a crucial role in the conspiracy to free [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart), and his journals—if they still exist—might contain valuable insights into the Thornwood's nature and the events leading to [the Binding](/lore/the-binding).
