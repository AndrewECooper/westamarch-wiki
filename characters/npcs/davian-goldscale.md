# High Priest Davian Goldscale

## Role
Leader of the Platinum Basilica (Temple of Bahamut)

## Race and Age
Gold Dragonborn, 54 years old

## Location
[The Platinum Basilica](/locations/westmarch/platinum-basilica), Temple Quarter

## Description
A prominent voice in city politics, Davian leads the largest temple in Westmarch. Recently, he has been having troubling prophetic dreams about darkness and chains. The hospital wing of the Platinum Basilica has seen an increase in patients with unusual ailments from near the forest.

## What He Knows
**[Tier 2, possibly brushing Tier 3](/lore/knowledge-tiers) through his dreams**: He senses something is deeply wrong but doesn't understand the cause. His prophetic dreams suggest a divine warning about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding), but he lacks the context to interpret them properly.

His dreams feature recurring imagery:
- Darkness spreading
- Chains breaking or corroding
- A sense of something imprisoned and stirring
- Suffering connected to the forest

## Current State
Increasingly concerned about his visions and the pattern of unusual illnesses appearing in patients from near the Thornwood. He is seeking answers while maintaining his public duties as leader of Westmarch's most prominent temple.

The hospital at the Platinum Basilica has documented a troubling increase in patients suffering from:
- Strange afflictions after exposure to the forest
- Unexplained fevers and nightmares
- Wounds that are slow to heal
- Symptoms that don't respond to normal healing magic

## Motivation
Protect the innocent, serve justice, understand his visions.

## Connections and Relationships
- **Faction**: Leader of [the Platinum Basilica](/locations/westmarch/platinum-basilica), part of [the Temples](/factions/the-temples)
- **Faith**: High Priest of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon
- **Political Role**: Prominent voice in city politics due to the Basilica's influence

## The Platinum Basilica
As leader of Westmarch's largest and most influential temple, High Priest Davian oversees:
- Daily worship and religious ceremonies
- The temple hospital, which serves the city's poor and injured
- Coordination with the City Watch on matters of justice
- Diplomatic functions involving the broader kingdom's religious hierarchy
- Distribution of charity and aid to those in need

## Divine Warning
Davian's prophetic dreams are not mere nightmares—they represent Bahamut's warning about the failing Binding. However, without knowledge of what the Binding truly is, he cannot properly interpret what his god is trying to tell him. He searches for meaning while the images of darkness and breaking chains haunt his sleep.

## Voice of Justice
In city politics, High Priest Davian is known as a voice for justice and protection of the innocent. His influence extends beyond religious matters into civic affairs, and his opinions carry weight with both nobility and common folk.
