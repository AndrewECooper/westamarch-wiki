# Lady Oona

**Role:** Archfey of the Winter Court
**Race/Age:** Archfey, ancient
**Location:** [The Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/singing-pools) (and elsewhere in the [Thornwood](/locations/thornwood))

## Description

An elegant fey woman whose presence is cold and still as winter's end. Lady Oona embodies **Regret and Broken Promises**, concepts that define her very nature and power.

She oversees the Singing Pools under the terms of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), a duty she performs with bitter precision. Her manner is formal, her words carefully chosen, her amusement at mortal struggles barely concealed beneath a veneer of icy courtesy.

## What She Knows

**Full truth about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) and the Pact's deception.** Lady Oona knows exactly what was done three centuries ago, how the Fey were deceived into maintaining a prison, and why the Anchor Stones are failing.

She knows who [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) is and why he was cursed, though she won't reveal it directly. She understands that the stone's failure is "addressing an imbalance in the bargain"—a cryptic reference to the deeper consequences of broken promises.

## Constraints

Bound by [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) to:
- Guard the Singing Pools
- Allow access to those who understand the Anchor Stones' purpose
- Cannot reveal the nature of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) directly

She follows the **letter** of her obligations, not the spirit. Every word is carefully measured to avoid breaking her bonds while giving away as little as possible—or as much as suits her purposes.

## Current State

Recently encountered the party when they came to the Singing Pools seeking the Source Stone:
- Allowed them access after [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen) accepted a curse
- Taunted [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) about his forgotten past
- Departed after they retrieved the Source Stone
- Watched with cold amusement as mortals struggled with the consequences of ancient bargains

## Motivation

- Honor her obligations (grudgingly and precisely)
- Watch the consequences of the Pact unfold
- Be entertained by mortal struggles with fate and choice
- Maintain the power that comes from her role and her nature
- Perhaps see justice done for the deception that bound her people
