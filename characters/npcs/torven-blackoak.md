# Guildmaster Torven Blackoak

**Role:** Leader of the [Delver's Guild](/factions/delvers-guild)
**Race/Age:** Human Ranger/Rogue, 38
**Location:** [The Frontier House](/locations/westmarch/frontier-house), [Greenmark](/locations/westmarch/greenmark)

## Description

A former Ranger who left the order under unclear circumstances—some say dishonorably discharged, others say he quit on principle. Torven knows more than he lets on about the [Thornwood](/locations/thornwood) and its dangers.

Pragmatic and profit-driven, he sees [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) as outdated bureaucracy that limits opportunity. He believes the forest's resources should be available to those willing to take the risks, not locked away behind ancient treaties and Ranger monopolies.

He maintains a complicated relationship with the [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)—respectful of their skills and knowledge, but resentful of their authority and the circumstances that led to his departure from their ranks.

## What He Knows

**Tier 2-3 knowledge.** Torven knows the forest well enough to sense something is wrong. His experience as a Ranger gave him insights most Delvers lack, and he may know more than he admits about the deeper mysteries of the Thornwood.

He's observed the increasing dangers, the strange behavior of creatures, and the patterns that suggest something systemic is failing. Whether he understands the true cause is unclear—he's careful about what he reveals.

## Motivation

- Profit and economic opportunity in the Thornwood
- Maintain independence from the Rangers
- Prove the Delvers' worth and legitimacy
- Protect his guild members' right to work in the forest
- Perhaps vindication for whatever led to his departure from the Rangers

## Connections

- [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) knows him through the [Archive of Ioun](/locations/westmarch/archive-of-ioun)—Torven occasionally seeks information about the Thornwood
- Former member of the [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green), departed under unclear circumstances
- Leads approximately 100 registered Delvers, all freelance operators who take contracts
- Works from [The Frontier House](/locations/westmarch/frontier-house) in [Greenmark](/locations/westmarch/greenmark)
