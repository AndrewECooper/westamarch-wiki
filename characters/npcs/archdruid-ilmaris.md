# Archdruid Ilmaris

**Role:** Druid leader during the Pact negotiations (status unknown)
**Race/Age:** Ancient Elf, possibly still alive
**Historical Period:** The Green War (920-940) and the Binding

## Description

An ancient elf druid who served [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) during the Green War but recognized the war was lost. Ilmaris played a crucial role in the negotiations that led to [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), representing the interests of the forest and those who served it.

He was a bridge between civilization and wilderness, someone who understood both the druids' devotion to the Greenheart and the humans' need to survive. This understanding made him essential to the peace process—and made him vulnerable to the deception that followed.

## Historical Role

**Negotiated on behalf of the forest** during the Greenwood Pact discussions in 940. As one of the few beings trusted by both sides, Ilmaris helped craft the terms that would supposedly bring peace between Westmarch and the Thornwood.

**Did not fully understand** that he was agreeing to maintain a prison rather than a peace treaty. Like the Fey, Ilmaris was deceived—though whether he eventually learned the truth is unknown.

His role was complex:
- Represented druid interests in the negotiations
- Served the Greenheart but recognized the war could not be won
- Trusted [Duke Garrick Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-garrick-westmarch) and other human negotiators
- Believed the Pact would bring genuine peace and balance
- May have been betrayed, or may have chosen to accept necessary compromise

## Current Status

**Unknown.** Ilmaris was ancient even during the Green War, 300 years ago. Several possibilities exist:

**Still alive:** Elves can live for centuries, and druids have ways of extending their lives. Ilmaris might still exist somewhere in the deep Thornwood, perhaps having learned the truth about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) long ago.

**Passed on knowledge to a successor:** He may have died but ensured his knowledge and role were inherited by another, creating a line of succession similar to House Westmarch's secret inheritance.

**Long dead:** He may have passed away peacefully after the Pact was signed, never learning he had been deceived.

## Potential Knowledge

If Ilmaris still lives, he would know:
- The details of the original negotiations
- The true intentions (or deceptions) of the human negotiators
- The ritual that created [the Binding](/lore/the-binding)
- The location and nature of the Anchor Stones
- Perhaps the truth about what was done and why

This makes him potentially invaluable—or potentially dangerous, depending on his current loyalties and understanding.

## Legacy

Whether alive or dead, Ilmaris's legacy shapes the current situation:

**The Circle of the Thornwood:** The druid organization he may have founded or influenced continues to serve as mediators between city and forest. [Archdruid Theron Mossbark](/characters/npcs/archdruid-theron-mossbark) carries on this tradition.

**The Deception's Weight:** If Ilmaris was truly deceived, his betrayal represents one of the great injustices of the Pact. If he understood and accepted the necessity, his choice adds moral complexity to the Binding.

**A Living Witness:** If he still lives, he is one of the few beings who can speak with direct authority about what really happened 300 years ago.

## Connections

- Negotiated [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) with [Duke Garrick Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-garrick-westmarch)
- Served [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) during the Green War
- May have influenced or founded the [Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)
- Possibly connected to [Archdruid Theron Mossbark](/characters/npcs/archdruid-theron-mossbark), who was young during the war
- Worked with or against the Fey Courts during the negotiations

## Current Relevance

If Ilmaris still lives, finding him could provide crucial answers about the Binding, the Pact, and what was truly intended versus what was truly done. His testimony could validate or challenge the moral foundations of Westmarch's existence.

If he is dead, his legacy lives on in the institutions he helped create and the unanswered questions about his role in the great deception.
