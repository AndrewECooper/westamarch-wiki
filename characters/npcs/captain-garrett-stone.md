# Captain Garrett Stone

## Role
Watch Commander of the [City Watch](/factions/city-watch)

## Race and Age
Human, 45 years old

## Location
The Watchtower, Oldtown

## Description
A career soldier who rose through the ranks, Stone is loyal to the city above all else and frustrated by noble politics interfering with his job. He's practical, direct, and respected by his troops.

## What He Knows
**[Tier 1-2 knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers)**: He knows the official history of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) and has noticed strange incidents increasing near the western wall for years—his records show the pattern—but he doesn't understand the supernatural cause.

## Current State
Managing an overworked Watch force of approximately 400 members who handle law enforcement, city defense, gate security, and emergency response. Increasingly concerned about the pattern of incidents near the western wall but lacks the context to understand what's causing them.

## Motivation
Keep order, protect citizens, do his job without political interference.

## Connections and Relationships
- **Faction**: Commander of the [City Watch](/factions/city-watch)
- **Second-in-Command**: [Lieutenant Kessa Ironfoot](/characters/npcs/lieutenant-kessa-ironfoot)
- **Reports to**: [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch) and the ducal court
- **Coordinates with**: [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green), [The Temples](/factions/the-temples)

## Leadership Style
Captain Stone is a practical, no-nonsense leader who believes in getting the job done efficiently. He rose through the ranks based on competence rather than connections, earning the loyalty of his troops through shared hardship and fair treatment. He has little patience for political maneuvering that interferes with the Watch's ability to protect Westmarch's citizens.

## The Pattern in the Records
Stone's meticulous record-keeping has documented years of increasing strange incidents near the western wall of the city—the area closest to the Thornwood. While he doesn't understand the supernatural cause, his records represent one of the few systematic documentations of [the Binding's](/lore/the-binding) gradual failure.

## Command Responsibilities
As Watch Commander, Captain Stone oversees:
- Law enforcement throughout Westmarch
- Gate security and wall patrols
- Investigation of crimes
- Emergency response
- Coordination with other city factions
- Management of approximately 400 Watch members
