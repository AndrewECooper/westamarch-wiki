# Percival

**Role:** Faerie Dragon, curious observer
**Race/Age:** Faerie Dragon, unknown
**Location:** The [Thornwood](/locations/thornwood) (mobile)

## Description

A curious faerie dragon who flits through the Thornwood, observing events with the capricious interest of his kind. Flighty and easily bored, Percival is nevertheless somewhat knowledgeable about the forest and its inhabitants.

He warned the party about a cranky bear during their journey to [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/singing-pools), displaying a mix of genuine helpfulness and fey mischief. True to his nature, he got bored shortly after meeting them and flew off in search of other diversions.

## What He Knows

**Rumors and observations.** Percival knows about "the little dragon-servants" (kobolds) in the area and general forest happenings. He picks up information the way a bird picks up shiny objects—without deep understanding but with an eye for interesting details.

He knows:
- Where creatures lair
- Which paths are dangerous
- What the forest gossip says
- Where interesting things are happening

Whether he understands the significance of what he knows is another question entirely.

## Current State

Mobile and unpredictable. He could be anywhere in the Thornwood at any given time, following his curiosity wherever it leads. He might remember the party if they meet again, or he might have completely forgotten them.

Faerie dragons are notoriously unreliable, but also surprisingly useful when they choose to be.

## Motivation

- Satisfy his endless curiosity
- Find entertainment and interesting sights
- Avoid serious danger (he's not suicidal)
- Play harmless (or not-so-harmless) pranks
- Move on when things get boring

## Connections

- Lives somewhere in the [Thornwood](/locations/thornwood)
- Part of the broader Fey presence in the forest
- Knows about the Poison Scale kobold tribe and their activities
- Met the party briefly during their journey to [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/singing-pools)

## Notes

Faerie dragons like Percival are typical of the lesser Fey—capricious, curious, and largely unconcerned with mortal affairs except as sources of entertainment. While not bound by [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) in the same way as greater Fey like [Lady Oona](/characters/npcs/lady-oona), they are still creatures of the Thornwood and subject to its deeper rhythms.
