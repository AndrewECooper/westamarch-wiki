# Duke Garrick Westmarch

**Role:** Founder of House Westmarch's rule (deceased)
**Race/Age:** Human, died ~990
**Historical Period:** The Green War (920-940) and the Binding

## Description

The Duke who ruled Westmarch during [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) and the signing of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) in 940. A pivotal figure in the city's history, Duke Garrick was granted hereditary rule in recognition of Westmarch's strategic importance as the border between civilization and the [Thornwood](/locations/thornwood).

He was one of the architects of the great deception—the conspiracy that tricked the Fey into believing they were maintaining a peace treaty when they were actually maintaining a prison for [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart).

## Historical Role

**Ruled Westmarch during its most critical period:**
- Led the city through the final years of the Green War
- Participated in or oversaw [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) ritual that imprisoned the Greenheart
- Negotiated [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) with the Fey and druids
- Accepted the burden of keeping the truth secret
- Established the mechanisms for maintaining the Anchor Stones

**One of the architects of the deception** that convinced the Fey they were maintaining a peace treaty rather than a prison. This deception has lasted 300 years, binding the Fey Courts to unwittingly guard the Greenheart's imprisonment.

## Legacy

Duke Garrick established several lasting institutions and traditions:

**The Secret Knowledge:** Created the tradition of passing the full truth about the Binding to each heir when they were ready to inherit the burden. This tradition continues with [Duke Aldric Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch) and will eventually pass to [Lady Sera Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lady-sera-westmarch).

**The Pact Wardens:** Founded the organization responsible for maintaining the Anchor Stones and keeping the secret. Though this organization has faded or been forgotten over the centuries, its purpose remains embedded in Westmarch's institutions.

**House Westmarch's Rule:** Established his family's hereditary control over the city, tying the ducal bloodline to the responsibility of maintaining the Binding for all time.

## The Weight of His Choice

Duke Garrick chose deception over honesty, imprisonment over reconciliation. Whether this was necessary pragmatism or a tragic mistake, his decision has shaped 300 years of history.

He knew:
- The Greenheart could not be killed
- The war was destroying both sides
- A permanent solution was needed
- The truth would destabilize the peace

His choice bought three centuries of stability, but at the cost of building a foundation on lies. Now that foundation is cracking.

## Connections

- Ruled during the Green War and the Binding
- Worked with [Archdruid Ilmaris](/characters/npcs/archdruid-ilmaris) during the Pact negotiations
- Commanded [Commander Edric Harrow](/characters/npcs/commander-edric-harrow) and other military leaders
- Negotiated with the Fey Courts, including ancient beings like [Lady Oona](/characters/npcs/lady-oona)
- Ancestor of [Duke Aldric Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch) and [Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch)

## Current Relevance

Though dead for over 300 years, Duke Garrick's legacy defines the current crisis. His deception is unraveling, his prison is failing, and his descendants must deal with the consequences of his choices.

[Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch), his descendant, is actively working to destroy everything Garrick built. Whether this is justice or betrayal depends on one's perspective.
