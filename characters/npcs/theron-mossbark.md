# Archdruid Theron Mossbark

## Role
Leader of the [Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)

## Race and Age
Wood Elf, 487 years old

## Location
The Grove (just outside Westmarch's western wall), occasionally the Oak Father's Grove in the Temple Quarter

## Description
Ancient beyond measure. Theron was young during the Green War but remembers it. He has led the Circle for over two centuries. Recently, he has become withdrawn and cryptic. He speaks in riddles, stares into the forest for hours, and sometimes refuses to explain his decisions. Some druids worry about his state of mind; others believe he's sensing something the rest cannot.

## What He Knows
**[Tier 4 knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers)**: Theron was present at [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). He knows the full truth:
- [The Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) was forcibly imprisoned
- [The Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) was built on deception
- Westmarch is a prison, not a peace agreement
- The true nature of the [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview)
- He carries centuries of guilt for his role in these events

## Current State
He knows the Binding is failing and suspects sabotage but doesn't know who is responsible. He keeps quiet because the more people who know, the more dangerous it becomes. He doesn't trust [Lord Brennan](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan) and is wary of anyone associated with him.

Some druids in the Circle worry about Theron's increasingly cryptic behavior and long silences, while others interpret his withdrawn nature as the wisdom of one who senses truths beyond mortal understanding.

## Motivation
Protect the balance, carry his burden of guilt, eventually pass the truth to those worthy of it.

## Connections and Relationships
- **Faction**: Leader of the [Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)
- **Age**: Old enough to have witnessed the Green War and the Binding itself
- **Coordinates with**: [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green), [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)
- **Faith**: Worships Silvanus, the Oak Father
- **Distrust**: Wary of [Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan) and his associates, including [Lyrique](/characters/player-characters/lyrique)

## The Weight of Centuries
Theron is one of the few living beings who was present when the Binding was performed. For nearly 300 years, he has carried the knowledge of what was truly done to end the Green War—not a noble peace, but a deception that imprisoned a living god. That guilt has shaped him across centuries of leadership.

## Recent Withdrawal
Those who know Theron notice he has become even more cryptic and withdrawn in recent months. He stares at the Thornwood for hours, speaks in riddles when questioned, and sometimes refuses to explain his decisions. This behavior correlates with the accelerating failure of the Binding, though most druids don't understand the connection.

## The Circle's Guardian
Despite his burden, Theron has led the Circle of the Thornwood faithfully for over two centuries, guiding them in their role as intermediaries between civilization and nature. He conducts seasonal rituals, provides wisdom to those who seek it, and maintains the sacred relationship with the forest—all while knowing the terrible truth underlying everything.
