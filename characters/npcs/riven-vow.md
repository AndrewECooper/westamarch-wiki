# Riven-Vow

**Role:** Redcap sentinel, guardian of [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/singing-pools)
**Race/Age:** Redcap (Fey), ~300 years
**Location:** [The Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/singing-pools)

## Description

A squat, brutal Redcap with a cap stained dark with old blood. His appearance is exactly as the tales describe—violent, crude, and menacing. But unlike the mindless murderers of legend, Riven-Vow serves a higher purpose.

Born from a mortal's vow of bloody revenge during the Green War, he is a creature of pure oath and duty. His entire existence is bound to a single purpose: protect the Pools and only allow passage to those who understand the Anchor Stones' purpose.

## Origin

Created approximately 300 years ago during the Green War, Riven-Vow emerged from someone's desperate vow of vengeance. That mortal is long dead, but their oath lives on in the Redcap's form, giving him purpose and binding him to [Lady Oona](/characters/npcs/lady-oona) and the Pools.

## What He Knows

**Only his oath.** Riven-Vow doesn't know the history, the politics, or the deeper truths about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). He knows his duty and nothing more: guard the Pools, test those who come, allow passage only to those who prove worthy.

He is a riddle-keeper and a gatekeeper, not a scholar or a conspirator.

## Current State

The party solved his riddle and proved they understood the purpose of the Anchor Stones. Satisfied that his duty was fulfilled, he allowed them passage and vanished into the mist.

Whether he still watches the Pools or has moved on to other duties is unknown. Redcaps born from oaths are unpredictable—they may linger, or they may disappear once their purpose is served.

## Motivation

**Fulfill his oath. Nothing else.**

There is no complexity to Riven-Vow's existence. He is the embodiment of a promise made in blood and rage, and he will serve that promise until it is fulfilled or he is destroyed.
