# The Temples of Westmarch

The five major temples in [the Temple Quarter](/locations/westmarch/temple-quarter) represent the primary faiths worshipped in [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview). While each maintains its own clergy, hierarchy, and theological focus, they cooperate on matters of city welfare, spiritual guidance, and increasingly, the supernatural crisis threatening the city.

The temples serve not only religious functions but also practical social services—providing healing, education, arbitration, aid to the poor, and preservation of knowledge. In times of crisis, the temples often prove more accessible and trusted by common citizens than distant noble authorities.

## The Five Temples

### The Platinum Basilica (Temple of Bahamut)

The largest and most prominent temple in Westmarch, dedicated to Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, god of justice, honor, and protection. The Basilica combines spiritual leadership with practical service to the community.

**Services Provided:**
- **Hospital**: The largest medical facility in Westmarch, providing healing both magical and mundane
- **Orphanage**: Caring for children who have lost parents to war, disease, or the recent refugee crisis
- **Training Yards**: Where paladins and holy warriors train in combat and martial discipline
- **Court of Justice**: Arbitrating disputes when civil courts prove inadequate

The Platinum Basilica maintains close ties with [the City Watch](/factions/city-watch), particularly through [Lieutenant Kessa Ironfoot](/characters/npcs/kessa-ironfoot), a devout follower of Bahamut.

**Current Focus**: Recently, the hospital has seen an increase in patients with unusual ailments from near the forest—nightmares, unexplained fears, strange marks. The clergy struggle to understand and treat these conditions.

### The Oak Father's Grove (Temple of Silvanus)

A living temple incorporating ancient trees, gardens, and herbalist workshops, dedicated to Silvanus, the Oak Father, god of nature and wilderness. This temple serves as the urban presence of [the Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood).

**Services Provided:**
- **Healing Gardens**: Cultivated medicinal herbs and plants
- **Herbalist Workshops**: Preparation of natural remedies
- **Nature Guidance**: Counseling on matters involving the forest and natural world
- **Seasonal Ceremonies**: Public rituals marking equinoxes and solstices

The Oak Father's Grove serves as a bridge between the city and [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview), offering urban dwellers connection to nature without requiring them to venture beyond the walls.

**Current Focus**: The druids and nature clerics report that the forest feels deeply wrong, and they struggle to understand what has changed and how to address it.

### The Hall of Law (Temple of Erathis)

A structured temple dedicated to Erathis, goddess of civilization, law, and community. The Hall functions as both spiritual center and practical institution of legal authority.

**Services Provided:**
- **Courthouse**: Formal trials and legal proceedings
- **Arbitration Center**: Mediating disputes between citizens
- **Legal Education**: Training in law and civic responsibility
- **Record Keeping**: Maintaining legal documents and contracts

The Hall of Law works closely with [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch) and [the City Watch](/factions/city-watch) to maintain order and administer justice fairly.

**Current Focus**: Increased disputes related to refugee settlement, property rights in [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens), and tensions over enforcement of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact).

### The Wayfarer's Chapel (Temple of Avandra)

A welcoming temple dedicated to Avandra, goddess of travel, freedom, and luck. The Chapel serves travelers, merchants, and those seeking new beginnings.

**Services Provided:**
- **Traveler's Aid**: Providing shelter, food, and guidance to travelers
- **Merchant Blessings**: Ceremonies seeking fortune for trading ventures
- **Refugee Support**: Working with [Elder Marissa Chen](/characters/npcs/elder-marissa-chen) to assist those fleeing to Westmarch
- **Luck Rituals**: Offerings seeking Avandra's favor

The Wayfarer's Chapel maintains connections with [the Merchant's Collective](/factions/merchants-collective) and actively supports refugees settling in the city.

**Current Focus**: The massive influx of refugees from the east has strained resources, and clerics work tirelessly to provide aid and help new arrivals find their place in the city.

### The Wayfarers' Hall (Refugee Community Center)

While technically a separate institution, the Wayfarers' Hall in [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) functions as an extension of Avandra's worship and cooperation between the temples. Led by [Elder Marissa Chen](/characters/npcs/elder-marissa-chen), it provides essential services to refugees and the poor.

**Services Provided:**
- **Food and Shelter**: Basic necessities for those with nowhere else to turn
- **Community Support**: Helping refugees build new lives and find work
- **Spiritual Guidance**: Pastoral care for those facing desperate circumstances
- **Coordination**: Working with all five temples to distribute aid

**Current Status**: The Hall was damaged during the Gray Morning fog event when an entity emerged from [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft). Elder Chen was injured but has since recovered. The community remains shaken but resilient.

## The Archive of Ioun

The [Archive of Ioun](/locations/westmarch/archive-of-ioun) is technically a temple dedicated to Ioun, goddess of knowledge, but functions primarily as a library and research institution. The three-story building contains the largest collection of books and historical documents in Westmarch.

**Collections:**
- **Public Library (Ground Floor)**: Accessible to all citizens, containing standard books and references
- **Restricted Stacks (Second Floor)**: Requiring permission, holding specialized texts, magical books, and historical records from [the Green War](/lore/the-green-war)
- **The Vault (Basement)**: Very restricted access, containing the oldest texts, some in languages few can read, with fragmentary references to [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) and [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart)

The Archive also houses one of the [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) in its basement, though this fact is known only to the highest leadership.

## Leadership

### High Priest Davian Goldscale

**Leader of the Platinum Basilica** | Gold Dragonborn, age 54 | Located in [the Temple Quarter](/locations/westmarch/temple-quarter)

[High Priest Davian Goldscale](/characters/npcs/davian-goldscale) is a prominent voice in city politics, leading the largest temple in Westmarch. Recently, he has been experiencing troubling prophetic dreams about darkness and chains. He senses something is deeply wrong but doesn't understand the cause.

Davian possesses standard knowledge of Westmarch's history, possibly approaching deeper understanding through his divine visions. His motivation centers on protecting the innocent, serving justice, and understanding the meaning of his troubling dreams.

### Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper

**Leader of the Archive of Ioun** | High Elf Wizard, age 312 | Located at [the Archive](/locations/westmarch/archive-of-ioun)

[Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) has spent centuries studying Westmarch's history. Where others dismiss ancient legends as exaggeration, she believes they are literal truth. She has been frantically pulling old texts about the Green War and the Greenwood Pact, insisting the ancient legends must be taken seriously.

Through extensive research, Elara has approached full understanding of the truth—she has found references to the Greenheart, the Binding, and the Seven Stones. She knows the Archive basement contains an Anchor Stone and suspects it is crucial to the city's survival.

**Current Activities:**
- Validated by recent discoveries, she coordinated with the temples to ward the damaged Warren Stone
- Researching methods to repair damaged Anchor Stones
- Discovered the Tess-Kydra's existence and its likely location at Harrow Keep
- Serving as employer and mentor to adventurers seeking to understand and address the crisis

**Connections:**
- Employer and mentor to those researching the crisis
- Former tutor to various nobles and scholars
- Connected to [Lady Sera Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lady-sera-westmarch) through scholarly circles

Her motivation focuses on uncovering the truth, preserving knowledge, and saving the city through understanding rather than force.

### Elder Marissa Chen

**Leader of the Wayfarers' Hall** | Human Cleric of Avandra, age 80 | Located in [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens)

[Elder Marissa Chen](/characters/npcs/elder-marissa-chen) is pragmatic and compassionate, leading the refugee community that has settled in the Warrens. She was injured during the fog beast attack but has since recovered.

Elder Chen possesses only surface knowledge of Westmarch's deeper secrets—she knows something terrible came from beneath the Hall and killed people, but doesn't understand the supernatural cause. Her motivation centers on protecting her community, helping refugees build new lives, and ensuring their survival in an increasingly dangerous city.

## Current Crisis

The temples face unprecedented challenges as supernatural events increase:

### Unexplained Ailments

The Platinum Basilica's hospital treats growing numbers of patients with conditions that defy conventional healing—nightmares that leave physical marks, fears that paralyze, unexplained exhaustion affecting those living near the western wall.

### Prophetic Dreams

Multiple clergy members, particularly High Priest Davian, report disturbing visions. The dreams speak of darkness, chains breaking, and something ancient stirring. The temples struggle to interpret these warnings.

### The Warren Stone

After the Gray Morning fog event, the temples discovered the damaged South Anchor Stone beneath the Wayfarers' Hall. Chief Archivist Elara coordinated a joint effort to ward the stone, containing the worst effects but not truly repairing the damage.

### Divided Responses

The temples debate how to respond:
- Some advocate revealing the truth to the public
- Others fear panic would do more harm than the crisis itself
- Still others argue for action without full disclosure
- All agree something must be done, but consensus on what remains elusive

### Resource Strain

The refugee crisis, combined with increasing supernatural incidents, stretches temple resources thin. The Wayfarers' Hall in particular struggles to provide adequate support with limited supplies and damaged facilities.

## Cooperation and Coordination

While each temple maintains independence, they coordinate on matters affecting the city as a whole:

### Temple Council

Leaders of the five temples meet regularly to discuss shared concerns, coordinate aid efforts, and present unified positions on matters of spiritual and civic importance.

### Joint Rituals

Major ceremonies sometimes involve multiple temples, particularly those seeking protection for the city or blessing for important endeavors.

### Shared Resources

The temples pool resources for disaster response, refugee aid, and matters requiring combined expertise—such as the warding of the damaged Anchor Stone.

### Information Sharing

Chief Archivist Elara serves as a nexus for information, sharing research findings with other temple leaders and coordinating investigation of supernatural events.

## Relationships

- **[House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)**: Cooperative relationship; temples provide spiritual guidance and social services while receiving support and legal authority from the ducal court
- **[The City Watch](/factions/city-watch)**: Close working relationship, particularly through Lieutenant Ironfoot's connection to the Platinum Basilica
- **[The Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)**: Generally cooperative, especially regarding nature-aligned worship; some philosophical differences about humanity's relationship with nature
- **[The Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)**: Respectful relationship; many Rangers worship Silvanus or other nature deities
- **[The Merchant's Collective](/factions/merchants-collective)**: Working relationship through the Wayfarer's Chapel and its service to traders
- **Citizens**: Trusted by most of the population; temples often prove more accessible than noble or military authorities

## Historical Significance

The temples have served Westmarch for centuries, providing continuity through times of peace and war. During [the Green War](/lore/the-green-war), the temples transformed from peacetime institutions to emergency responders, providing healing, shelter, and spiritual sustenance to a traumatized population.

After the signing of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), the temples helped rebuild civil society and restore hope. The current crisis tests whether they can again provide the leadership and support the city desperately needs.

## Notable Resources

### The Archive's Research

Chief Archivist Elara's research has uncovered crucial information:
- References to the Greenheart and the Binding in ancient texts
- Fragmentary accounts of the ritual that imprisoned the forest's consciousness
- Information about the Anchor Stones and their function
- The existence and location of the Tess-Kydra
- Possible methods for repairing damaged stones

This knowledge makes the Archive indispensable to understanding and addressing the crisis.

### Healing and Protection

The temples provide the primary source of magical healing, protection from supernatural threats, and divine guidance. As mundane solutions prove inadequate, these resources become increasingly vital.

### Moral Authority

The temples command respect and trust from the population in ways secular authorities sometimes cannot. Their unified voice on matters of civic importance carries significant weight, particularly during times of fear and uncertainty.

The question facing the temples now is whether to use this moral authority to reveal uncomfortable truths or to maintain stability through continued secrecy—a decision that may determine the city's fate.
