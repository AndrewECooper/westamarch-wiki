# The Fey Courts

The Fey Courts are organized groups of supernatural beings who inhabit [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview), born from the power of promises and vows. Unlike mortal factions with conventional hierarchies and political structures, the Fey operate according to alien logic rooted in oaths, bargains, and the inexorable turning of seasons.

Their relationship with [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview) is defined by [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact)—a treaty they were deceived into accepting, creating centuries of tension, obligation, and resentment. The Fey are bound by the letter of their agreements but follow the spirit grudgingly, if at all.

## The Nature of Fey

### Born from Promises

Fey are creatures created when promises and vows carry sufficient conviction and power:

- A promise to a friend can birth a fairy
- A vow to master a craft can create a sprite
- Promises of revenge or spite create darker fey—redcaps, bogeys, hags
- Dying regrets manifest as banshees
- The most universal promises become powerful entities

The more universal and deeply felt a promise, the more powerful the resulting fey. The promise of nature's eternal cycle—Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter—gave birth to Courts ruled by mighty Archfey.

### Bound by Oaths

Because fey are born from promises, they are fundamentally creatures of obligation and contract. They cannot break oaths lightly—doing so damages their essential nature. However, they excel at following the letter of agreements while violating the spirit, finding loopholes, and extracting maximum advantage from every bargain.

This trait makes them simultaneously reliable and dangerous—they will honor their word, but that word may not mean what you think it means.

### Alien Logic

Fey do not think as mortals do. Their motivations, values, and reasoning follow patterns shaped by their supernatural origins:

- Time means different things to beings who might be immortal
- Morality is measured by adherence to oaths rather than conventional ethics
- Beauty, art, and emotion hold value beyond practical concerns
- Insults and slights matter more than physical harm
- Entertainment and curiosity drive behavior as much as self-interest

Attempting to predict or manipulate fey using mortal logic often fails catastrophically.

## The Four Courts

The Fey of the Thornwood are organized into four seasonal courts. Power shifts between them as the year turns—at each equinox and solstice, dominance passes to the appropriate court.

### The Spring Court

**Season of Power**: Spring Equinox to Summer Solstice

**Themes**: New beginnings, growth, hope, renewal, innocence, potential

**Nature**: Spring fey embody fresh starts and possibilities. They are often playful, optimistic, and focused on creation and growth. However, they can be naive, reckless, and heedless of consequences.

**Promises**: Born from vows of new beginnings, second chances, hope for the future, and dedications to growth and learning.

**Current Status**: Currently rising in power as early spring arrives (current date: Greenleaf 24th). Spring fey become more active and influential as their season approaches dominance.

### The Summer Court

**Season of Power**: Summer Solstice to Autumn Equinox

**Themes**: Passion, vitality, abundance, love, ambition, achievement

**Nature**: Summer fey embody life at its fullest. They are passionate, energetic, and driven. However, they can be overwhelming, excessive, and destructive in their intensity.

**Promises**: Born from vows of love, dedications to ambitious goals, promises of passionate commitment, and oaths to achieve greatness.

**Current Status**: Will become dominant in coming months as summer approaches. Summer fey currently prepare for their time of power.

### The Autumn Court

**Season of Power**: Autumn Equinox to Winter Solstice

**Themes**: Harvest, preparation, change, transition, completion, decay

**Nature**: Autumn fey embody endings and transformation. They are pragmatic, focused on completion and consequence. However, they can be harsh, unforgiving, and ruthless in their practicality.

**Promises**: Born from vows to finish what was started, promises of reaping what was sown, and acceptance of necessary endings.

**Current Status**: Recently passed out of dominance as winter ended and spring began. Autumn fey are currently at their weakest point in the cycle.

### The Winter Court

**Season of Power**: Winter Solstice to Spring Equinox

**Themes**: Endings, regret, reflection, broken promises, cold beauty, sorrow

**Nature**: Winter fey embody the cold stillness of year's end. They are patient, calculating, and focused on consequences and debts. They remember everything, especially wrongs and broken promises.

**Promises**: Born from vows involving sorrow, loss, revenge, and particularly from broken promises—the regret of failing to keep one's word creates winter fey.

**Notable Figure**: [Lady Oona](/characters/npcs/lady-oona), Archfey of the Winter Court, embodies Regret and Broken Promises.

**Current Status**: Currently waning as spring arrives but still powerful. Winter fey do not surrender dominance easily—their power fades slowly, like snow melting reluctantly under spring sun.

## Fey and the Greenheart

The relationship between the Fey Courts and [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) is complex and varies by court and individual:

### Before the Binding

Many fey lived in the Thornwood peacefully for centuries before [the Green War](/lore/the-green-war). The forest's primordial consciousness and the fey courts coexisted—separate entities but symbiotic, like trees and the mycelial network connecting their roots.

When the Greenheart awakened and the war began, some fey fought as the forest's champions, some fled, and some attempted mediation.

### The Deception

The Fey Courts were crucial to [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact). The treaty's architects needed the fey to help maintain [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) and guard key locations like [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools).

The fey were not told the full truth. They believed they were negotiating a peace treaty and agreeing to maintain balance between civilization and nature. They did not understand they were agreeing to perpetuate a forced imprisonment.

### Current Feelings

Fey attitudes toward the Binding vary:

- **Some want the Greenheart freed**: They feel betrayed by the deception and believe the imprisonment is unjust
- **Some fear freedom**: They remember the Green War and dread what might happen if the Greenheart fully awakens
- **Some are bound by oath**: Regardless of personal feelings, they made promises and must honor them
- **Some are entertained**: For certain fey, the entire situation is fascinating theater—tragedy, betrayal, consequences

Most fey feel complicated mixtures of these positions, shifting with circumstances and mood.

### The Binding's Failure

As [the Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) fail, the fey sense the change. Some see it as addressing an imbalance in the bargain. Others view it as potentially catastrophic. All recognize that fundamental change is coming.

## Notable Fey

### Lady Oona

**Archfey of the Winter Court** | Ancient | [The Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools) and elsewhere

[Lady Oona](/characters/npcs/lady-oona) is an elegant fey woman whose presence embodies the cold stillness of winter's end. She is Regret and Broken Promises made manifest—every failed oath, every abandoned vow feeds her power.

**Role**: She oversees the Singing Pools under the terms of the Greenwood Pact, bound to allow access to those who understand the Anchor Stones' purpose. She follows the letter of her obligations but not the spirit.

**Knowledge**: Lady Oona knows the full truth about the Binding and the Pact's deception. She knows things about individuals that they themselves have forgotten—including [Quill's](/characters/player-characters/quill) cursed past and forgotten identity.

**Nature**: She is bound by the Pact to guard the Pools and allow access under specific conditions. She cannot reveal the nature of the Binding directly—her oath forbids it. However, she can hint, taunt, and allow others to discover the truth.

**Current State**: She allowed the party access to the Pools after [Kaelen](/characters/player-characters/kaelen) accepted a curse, demonstrating that she honors her bargains even when doing so is inconvenient. She departed after they retrieved the Source Stone, having fulfilled her obligation.

**Motivation**: Honor her obligations grudgingly, watch the consequences of the Pact unfold, and be entertained by mortal struggles with forces beyond their understanding.

### Riven-Vow

**Redcap Sentinel** | Approximately 300 years old | [The Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools)

[Riven-Vow](/characters/npcs/riven-vow) is a squat, brutal redcap—a type of dark fey born from violent promises—with a cap stained dark with old blood. His name suggests he was born from a vow torn in two, likely a promise of bloody revenge during the Green War.

**Role**: Guardian of the Singing Pools, allowing passage only to those who understand the Anchor Stones' purpose. He enforces this rule through riddles and violence.

**Knowledge**: Only his oath. He doesn't know the history or politics—just his duty. He exists to fulfill his promise and cares for nothing else.

**Current State**: The party solved his riddle and he allowed them passage, vanishing into the mist. He will return if others approach the Pools, asking his riddle again and again, forever, until released from his oath or destroyed.

**Motivation**: Fulfill his oath. Nothing else exists for him.

### Percival

**Faerie Dragon** | Age unknown | Mobile throughout [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview)

[Percival](/characters/npcs/percival) is a curious faerie dragon who observes events in the forest with interest. Unlike the more powerful and alien Archfey, he is relatively approachable and willing to interact with mortals—as long as they don't bore him.

**Role**: Observer and occasional messenger. Faerie dragons serve as the forest's gossips, spreading information and rumors throughout the Thornwood.

**Knowledge**: Rumors and observations. He knows about "the little dragon-servants" (kobolds) in the area, general forest happenings, and various interesting events. His knowledge is fragmentary but sometimes useful.

**Current State**: He warned the party about a cranky bear during their journey to the Singing Pools, then got bored and left. He may appear again if something interesting catches his attention.

**Motivation**: Curiosity, entertainment, avoiding danger while observing interesting events.

### Other Fey

The Thornwood contains many other fey beings, each born from different promises and oaths:

**Light Fey**:
- **Dryads and Nymphs**: Tied to specific trees or waters, beautiful and protective of their domains
- **Satyrs and Fauns**: Mischievous musicians embodying wild joy
- **Sprites and Pixies**: Tiny, chaotic beings born from small promises
- **Unicorns**: Rare creatures embodying purity and natural sanctity

**Dark Fey**:
- **Redcaps**: Born from violent promises, they dye their caps in blood
- **Bogeys**: Creatures of fear and nightmares
- **Hags**: Born from promises to inflict pain or extract revenge
- **Banshees**: Manifestations of dying regrets

Each follows its own logic, pursues its own goals, and honors its own oaths.

## Fey Territories

The Courts claim different territories within the Thornwood:

### The Singing Pools

Sacred territory currently overseen by Lady Oona and the Winter Court. The pools serve as the Greenheart's primary sensorium—its "eyes" and "ears"—and contain the crystalline deposits used to create the Anchor Stones.

### The Bone Garden

A clearing filled with bones from the Green War and earlier times. A sacred site to multiple courts, entering without permission means death. Strange magic lingers here, and fey conduct important rituals among the bones.

### The Walking Grove

A section of forest that literally moves—trees relocate, paths rearrange, landmarks shift. This area belongs to Spring and Autumn courts in rotation, embodying transition and change.

### Seasonal Glens

Various clearings and groves associated with specific courts, shifting in appearance and power as the seasons turn.

### Neutral Grounds

Some areas belong to no specific court, serving as meeting places when representatives of different courts must interact without seasonal advantage.

## Fey and the Pact

### Treaty Obligations

Under the Greenwood Pact, the Fey Courts agreed to:

- Guard certain locations (like the Singing Pools)
- Allow access to those who meet specific conditions
- Maintain the boundaries marked by the Border Stones
- Not attack humans who respect the Pact's terms
- Participate in the seasonal balance maintaining the treaty

### Interpretation

The fey follow these obligations precisely—according to their interpretation of the letter, not necessarily the spirit:

- They guard locations but make access difficult and dangerous
- They allow access to those meeting conditions but might hurt them afterward
- They maintain boundaries but punish violations harshly and creatively
- They don't attack humans respecting the Pact but define "respect" narrowly
- They participate in balance while working toward their own interests

### Violations and Retaliation

When the Pact is violated—by excessive logging, unauthorized entry, or similar acts—the fey retaliate:

- Hunters disappear in the forest
- Crops near the border fail mysteriously
- Nightmares plague those living near the wall
- Tools and equipment malfunction or vanish
- Luck turns consistently bad for violators

These retaliations technically fall within Pact terms—the fey punish violations but don't launch open war.

## Bargaining with Fey

Those who must deal with fey should understand several principles:

### Everything is a Bargain

Fey view all interactions as potential exchanges. Asking a question, requesting aid, or even accepting a gift creates obligation.

### Words Matter

Fey take language literally. Promises, agreements, and even casual statements may bind you in ways you don't anticipate. Choose words carefully.

### Loopholes are Features

Fey excel at finding creative interpretations of agreements. What seems clear in negotiation may prove very different in execution.

### Names Have Power

Giving your true name to fey grants them power over you. Use caution when introducing yourself or identifying others.

### Debts Must Be Paid

Obligations to fey don't disappear. If you owe a debt, you will pay it—the only questions are when, how, and whether you survive.

### Offense is Remembered

Fey remember insults forever. What seems trivial to mortals—forgetting courtesy, dismissing their concerns, showing disrespect—can create enemies that last lifetimes.

## Current Status

The Fey Courts face their own crisis as the Binding fails:

### Sensing Change

All fey feel the Anchor Stones weakening and the Greenheart stirring. This creates:

- **Uncertainty**: What happens when the Binding fully fails?
- **Division**: Courts and individuals disagree about whether to help maintain, actively destroy, or simply observe
- **Opportunity**: The changing situation creates openings for ambitious fey to increase their power
- **Danger**: If the Greenheart fully awakens, even fey may face consequences

### Shifting Alliances

The courts' relationships are changing:

- Some Winter and Autumn fey favor maintaining the Binding
- Some Spring and Summer fey support liberation
- But these are tendencies, not absolute positions
- Individual fey pursue their own interests regardless of court alignment

### Increased Activity

Fey have become more visible and active:

- More frequent encounters near the border
- Greater interference with human activities
- Bolder statements and actions
- Less adherence to diplomatic niceties

The situation's fluidity gives fey more freedom to act on their own interpretations of their obligations.

### Watching and Waiting

Many fey, particularly the most powerful, adopt a wait-and-see approach:

- They honor their oaths while minimizing cooperation
- They watch events unfold with interest
- They position themselves to benefit from whatever comes next
- They remember that they've survived centuries by being patient

## Relationships

- **[The Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart)**: Complex relationship varying by individual; some serve willingly, some fear it, all are affected by it
- **[House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)**: Treaty-bound relationship through the Greenwood Pact; formal but increasingly strained
- **[The Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)**: Regular interaction through border patrols; Rangers understand fey better than most mortals but still struggle
- **[The Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)**: Complex relationship; druids understand fey nature better than most humans but fey view them with suspicion
- **[The City Watch](/factions/city-watch)**: Minimal interaction; Watch has no framework for understanding or dealing with fey
- **[The Delver's Guild](/factions/delvers-guild)**: Antagonistic; Delvers try to avoid provoking fey while working in their territory
- **Mortals Generally**: Fey view mortals as short-lived, impulsive, and often entertaining—sometimes allies, sometimes victims, rarely equals

## Philosophy and Perspective

The fey operate according to principles foreign to mortal thinking:

### Time is Fluid

When you might be immortal, decades pass like seasons. What seems urgent to mortals is merely interesting to fey.

### Oaths are Identity

Since fey are born from promises, keeping oaths is essential to existence. Breaking vows damages their fundamental nature.

### Beauty Over Utility

Aesthetics, art, and emotion matter more than practical concerns. Something can be right simply because it's beautiful.

### Stories Have Power

Fey view events as narratives with patterns and rules. Playing the expected role in a story has weight beyond simple actions.

### Balance is Sacred

The turning of seasons, the cycle of growth and decay, the exchange of debts—these patterns must be honored.

### Entertainment is Valuable

Curiosity, amusement, and the joy of watching interesting events unfold motivate fey behavior as much as any practical goal.

## Historical Role

The Fey Courts have inhabited the Thornwood for millennia, predating human settlement. During the Green War, they faced impossible choices—support the Greenheart and fight civilization, or seek peace and risk betraying their home.

The Greenwood Pact seemed to offer a middle path—maintaining balance between forest and city. The deception at its heart—that the treaty perpetuates forced imprisonment rather than mutual agreement—created a wound that has never healed.

For 300 years, the fey have honored their obligations while resenting the deception. Now, as the Binding fails, they face the consequences of that ancient choice and must decide whether to uphold oaths made under false pretenses or pursue a different path.

The question facing the Fey Courts is not whether to honor their word—they must—but how to interpret obligations made in the context of a lie, and whether the letter of their oaths requires supporting a system built on deception.
