# House Westmarch and the Ducal Court

House Westmarch is the ruling noble family of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview), the border city that stands between the kingdom and [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview). The family has governed the city for 300 years since the signing of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), granted their hereditary position in recognition of the city's strategic importance as the keystone of the treaty.

The ducal court serves as both the governing body of Westmarch and the administrative apparatus through which the Duke exercises authority. Based in [the Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel), the court manages relations with the broader kingdom, collects taxes, administers justice, and maintains the delicate balance required by the ancient Pact.

## Role and Authority

House Westmarch serves several crucial functions:

- **Governance**: Administration of the city's seven districts, management of civil affairs, and enforcement of law
- **Diplomacy**: Representation of Westmarch's interests to the royal court and maintenance of relations with the kingdom
- **Defense**: Command of military forces and coordination with [the Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green) and [the City Watch](/factions/city-watch)
- **Treaty Stewardship**: Preservation of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) and management of relations with the forest and its inhabitants
- **Secret Burden**: Maintenance of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) and protection of the city from the imprisoned [Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart)

The Duke's authority is considerable within the city, though technically subject to royal oversight. In practice, the distance from the capital and the specialized knowledge required to govern a border city grant House Westmarch substantial autonomy.

## Goals

The official goals of House Westmarch include:

- Maintain order and stability in Westmarch
- Preserve the Greenwood Pact and honor the ancient treaty
- Manage relations with the broader kingdom
- Collect taxes and administer justice
- Protect the city from external threats

The family's secret goal, known only to a select few, is to maintain the Binding and keep the Greenheart imprisoned—a burden passed down through generations from Duke to heir.

## Key Members

### Duke Aldric Westmarch

**Ruler of Westmarch** | Human, age 52 | Located in [the Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)

[Duke Aldric Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch) was once a vigorous and engaged ruler, but has become increasingly withdrawn over the past year. He holds fewer public audiences, seems paranoid, and spends long hours alone in the Citadel's deep vaults. Court officials whisper concerns about his health and judgment.

The Duke possesses full knowledge of the Binding, [the Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview), and Westmarch's true role as a prison. He has discovered that the Binding is failing faster than it should, and checks the Central Anchor Stone obsessively, attempting to maintain it with limited resources. Terrified and isolated, he trusts almost no one and doesn't know who to turn to.

His primary motivation is to protect the city and his family, keeping the Binding intact until his daughter Sera is ready to inherit the terrible burden of knowledge.

### Duchess Elara Westmarch

**Duke's Wife and Court Manager** | Human, age 48 | Located in [the Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)

[Duchess Elara Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duchess-elara-westmarch) is diplomatic and capable, having taken over many day-to-day court functions as her husband withdraws from public life. She is clearly worried about Aldric but maintains composure in public appearances.

Whether Duchess Elara has been told the family secrets remains unclear—Duke Aldric may be keeping her in the dark to protect her from the burden. Her motivations center on supporting her husband, protecting her daughter, and maintaining stability at court during an increasingly difficult time.

### Lord Brennan Westmarch

**Duke's Brother and Political Figure** | Human, age 49 | Located in Northbank estate, frequently at court

[Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch) is charismatic and popular, especially with common folk, merchants, and younger nobles. He speaks passionately about "Westmarch's future" and "opportunities for all," arguing that the city must be allowed to grow and that the Pact, while important, should evolve with the times. Many see him as a voice of progress and compassion, particularly for his support of refugees and the poor.

However, Lord Brennan's public persona masks a darker truth. He possesses full knowledge of the Binding and has been actively working to destroy it as the primary agent of Verdanthis within the city. He has been subtly damaging the Northwest Anchor Stone beneath his own estate in [Northbank](/locations/westmarch/northbank) for months.

His true motivations remain complex—he may genuinely believe freeing the Greenheart is right, or he may have been promised power in the new order that would follow the Binding's collapse.

### Lady Sera Westmarch

**Duke's Daughter and Heir** | Human, age 26 | Located in [the Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)

[Lady Sera Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lady-sera-westmarch) is intelligent and curious, with a keen interest in magic and history. She has been sheltered from the darker truths of her family's legacy and possesses only surface knowledge of the Greenwood Pact and Westmarch's history.

Her father intends to eventually reveal the family secrets to her, but doesn't believe she is ready for the burden. She studies magic through arrangements made via [Chief Archivist Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) of [the Archive of Ioun](/locations/westmarch/archive-of-ioun).

Lady Sera's current focus is on learning and growing into her eventual role as Westmarch's leader, unaware of what that leadership will truly require.

## Headquarters

House Westmarch governs from [the Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel), the massive stone fortress at the heart of Westmarch. The keep houses:

- The throne room and council chambers where official business is conducted
- The Hall of Records containing centuries of administrative documents
- The Inner Ward with barracks, training grounds, and gardens
- The Duke's private quarters and chambers
- The Deep Vaults far beneath the keep, accessible only through the Duke's private chambers, where the Central Anchor Stone is housed

The Citadel dominates the city's skyline and serves as a constant reminder of the ducal family's authority and responsibility.

## Current Status

House Westmarch faces its greatest crisis in generations. Duke Aldric's withdrawal from public life has created a power vacuum that his brother Brennan has begun to fill, though few realize Brennan's true agenda. The Duchess attempts to maintain stability, but growing tensions at court and in the city make this increasingly difficult.

The Duke knows the Binding is failing but cannot determine the cause or identify potential allies. His paranoia, while rooted in genuine danger, prevents him from seeking the help he desperately needs. Meanwhile, the heir to House Westmarch remains unaware that she may inherit a city on the brink of catastrophe.

The court continues to function, maintaining the appearance of normalcy while internal tensions mount. How long this facade can hold remains uncertain.

## Relationships

- **[The Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)**: Close working relationship; the Duke coordinates with High Ranger Mira Thornweaver on matters relating to the Greenwood Pact
- **[The City Watch](/factions/city-watch)**: Direct command authority; Captain Garrett Stone reports to the ducal court
- **[The Temples](/factions/the-temples)**: Cooperative relationship; the temples provide spiritual guidance and social services
- **[The Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)**: Respectful but somewhat distant; Archdruid Theron Mossbark is one of the few who shares knowledge of the Binding
- **[The Merchant's Collective](/factions/merchants-collective)**: Economic partnership; Speaker Marna Goldleaf represents merchant interests at court
- **[The Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts)**: Treaty-bound relationship through the Greenwood Pact; formal but increasingly strained
- **The Royal Court**: Nominally subordinate but functionally autonomous due to distance and specialized knowledge

## Historical Legacy

The position of House Westmarch was established in year 940 when Duke Garrick Westmarch, who ruled during [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) and the signing of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), was granted hereditary rule in recognition of the city's crucial importance. Duke Garrick was one of the architects of the deception that secured the Pact, establishing the tradition of passing secret knowledge from ruler to heir.

For over 300 years, House Westmarch has maintained this terrible secret, each generation carrying the burden of knowing that their city is built upon a prison and that the peace depends upon maintaining a forced imprisonment. The current crisis tests whether this legacy of secrecy can endure or whether the truth will finally emerge.
