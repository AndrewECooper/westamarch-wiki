# The Delver's Guild

The Delver's Guild is an organization of adventurers, explorers, hunters, and resource gatherers who venture into dangerous places others avoid—primarily [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview) and [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft). With approximately 100 registered members, all operating as freelance contractors rather than employees, the Guild represents those willing to risk life and limb for profit and glory.

Unlike [the Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green), who serve the city and honor [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), Delvers are entrepreneurs who work in the forest under license from [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch). They see the Pact's restrictions not as sacred obligations but as bureaucratic limitations on opportunity.

## Role and Function

The Delver's Guild serves several interconnected purposes:

- **Resource Harvesting**: Legally gathering forest materials—herbs, game, rare woods, alchemical components—under license from the Duke
- **Contract Work**: Taking on dangerous jobs others won't touch—monster hunting, expedition guarding, salvage operations, underground exploration
- **Frontier Expertise**: Providing wilderness skills and knowledge to those who need to venture beyond the walls
- **Risk Taking**: Doing work that requires accepting danger in exchange for potentially substantial rewards
- **Independent Operations**: Maintaining the right to work in the forest and Undercroft independently of the Rangers

The Guild operates in the gray area between legal and illegal, respectable and disreputable. Most Delvers hold proper licenses and follow the rules—more or less—but the nature of their work attracts those comfortable with risk and flexible ethics.

## Organization

### Guildmaster

The leader of the Guild, responsible for maintaining relationships with the ducal court, coordinating major contracts, and representing Delver interests. The position is elected by guild members, though in practice the most successful and respected Delver usually wins.

### Senior Delvers

Experienced members who have survived years of dangerous work. They mentor newer members, lead complex expeditions, and serve as informal advisors to the Guildmaster.

### Licensed Delvers

Full guild members holding valid licenses to work in the Thornwood and undertake dangerous contracts. Licenses are expensive and require approval from House Westmarch, making membership a privilege.

### Apprentices

New or unproven members working under supervision of senior Delvers, learning the skills necessary to survive and profit from dangerous work.

### Associates

Non-members who work with the Guild occasionally—guides, information brokers, equipment suppliers, and others who support Delver operations without being full members.

## Leadership

### Guildmaster Torven Blackoak

**Leader of the Delver's Guild** | Human Ranger/Rogue, age 38 | Located at [the Frontier House](/locations/westmarch/the-frontier-house)

[Guildmaster Torven Blackoak](/characters/npcs/torven-blackoak) is a former Ranger who left the order under circumstances that remain unclear—some say he was dishonorably discharged, others claim he quit in protest. The truth likely lies somewhere between.

Torven is pragmatic and profit-driven, viewing [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) as outdated bureaucracy that unnecessarily limits opportunity. He argues that skilled professionals should be allowed to work in the forest responsibly without excessive restrictions.

He maintains a complicated relationship with [the Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)—respectful of their skills but resentful of their authority and what he sees as their rigid adherence to an arbitrary treaty. Some Rangers view him as a sellout who abandoned sacred obligations for profit; others respect his skills while disagreeing with his choices.

Torven knows [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview) better than most non-Rangers, having spent years patrolling it before leaving the order. He senses something is wrong in the forest and may know more than he admits about the current crisis.

He occasionally seeks information from [the Archive of Ioun](/locations/westmarch/archive-of-ioun), indicating intellectual curiosity beyond simple profit-seeking. His motivations center on profit, independence, and proving that Delvers can serve the city as effectively as Rangers without being bound by ancient oaths.

## Headquarters

The Delver's Guild operates from [the Frontier House](/locations/westmarch/the-frontier-house), a rowdy tavern in [the Greenmark](/locations/westmarch/the-greenmark) that serves as social hub, business center, and symbol of the Delver lifestyle.

The Frontier House includes:

### The Common Room

A loud, rough tavern where Delvers drink, brag, fight, and conduct business. The atmosphere is chaotic but authentic—this is where people come when they want real wilderness expertise rather than polite consultation.

### The Job Board

A prominent board displaying available contracts—monster hunting, escort jobs, resource gathering, underground exploration, and various other dangerous work. Anyone can post a job, but the Guild takes a percentage of contracts filled through the board.

### The Gear Shop

A well-stocked shop selling specialized equipment for dangerous work—climbing gear, alchemical supplies, maps, weapons, and various tools of the trade. Prices are high but quality is reliable.

### Guild Offices

Private rooms where Torven conducts business, negotiates contracts, and maintains records. Less chaotic than the common room, though still far from formal.

### Private Rooms

Lodging for Delvers between jobs or those who prefer staying close to the action rather than renting rooms elsewhere.

The Frontier House's location in the Greenmark, near [the Greenwatch](/locations/westmarch/the-greenwatch), creates both convenience and tension—Delvers and Rangers share the district and must navigate their complicated relationship daily.

## Operations

### Legal Forest Work

The primary source of legitimate income involves contracts for:

- **Herb Gathering**: Collecting rare medicinal and alchemical plants
- **Hunting**: Providing game meat and exotic animal materials
- **Timber**: Harvesting wood from permitted areas
- **Rare Materials**: Finding components for magical crafting
- **Mineral Prospecting**: Searching for valuable stones and ores

All such work requires proper licenses and adherence (more or less) to Pact restrictions about where and what can be harvested.

### Monster Hunting

Delvers handle dangerous creatures that threaten travelers or settlements:

- **Beast Removal**: Dealing with aggressive animals
- **Monster Elimination**: Hunting supernatural threats
- **Nest Clearing**: Removing creature infestations
- **Bounty Collection**: Taking on contracts for specific dangerous entities

This work is dangerous but profitable, and establishes Delvers as useful to the city's security.

### Expedition Services

Providing expertise and protection for those who must venture into dangerous areas:

- **Guard Work**: Protecting merchants, scholars, or nobles traveling through wilderness
- **Guiding**: Leading expeditions to specific locations
- **Salvage Operations**: Recovering items or information from dangerous areas
- **Reconnaissance**: Scouting and gathering intelligence

### Undercroft Exploration

Some Delvers specialize in navigating [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft)—the city's sewers and underground passages:

- **Mapping**: Charting unexplored sections
- **Salvage**: Recovering lost items or investigating collapse sites
- **Pest Control**: Dealing with creatures living underground
- **Smuggling Routes**: Though Delvers officially don't support smuggling, some know the underground passages well

## Goals

The Delver's Guild pursues several objectives:

- **Profit**: Making money from dangerous work others won't do
- **Independence**: Maintaining the right to work in the forest independently of the Rangers
- **Recognition**: Gaining respect as valuable contributors to the city's welfare
- **Member Protection**: Defending Delver interests against excessive regulation or persecution
- **Opportunity**: Expanding the scope of permitted activities and reducing Pact restrictions

These goals frequently bring the Guild into conflict with the Rangers and druids who view Pact restrictions as sacred rather than negotiable.

## Current Status

The Delver's Guild faces both challenges and opportunities in the current crisis:

### Increased Danger

The forest has become significantly more dangerous over the past year:
- **More Aggressive Creatures**: Encounters turn deadly more frequently
- **Strange Occurrences**: Delvers report areas that feel wrong or hostile
- **Missing Members**: Several Delvers have disappeared on forest contracts
- **Reduced Harvesting**: Some areas have become too dangerous to work

This danger reduces profitable operations while increasing demand for protection services.

### Business Opportunities

The crisis creates new work:
- **Investigation Contracts**: People hire Delvers to investigate strange occurrences
- **Escort Demand**: More clients need protection venturing beyond the walls
- **Emergency Work**: Urgent contracts pay premium rates
- **Monster Hunting**: Increased creature aggression means more elimination contracts

Guildmaster Torven must balance member safety against profitable opportunities.

### Relationship Tensions

The situation strains the already complicated relationship with the Rangers:
- Some Rangers blame Delver activity for provoking forest hostility
- Delvers argue Rangers' rigid approach prevents flexible response to the crisis
- Both groups recognize the need for cooperation but struggle with mutual distrust
- Some individual Rangers and Delvers maintain good personal relationships despite institutional tension

### Knowledge and Secrecy

Delvers are noticing things:
- The forest's behavior suggests more than random animal aggression
- Patterns in disappearances hint at organized opposition
- Some contracts involve recovering information that raises troubling questions
- Guildmaster Torven may know more than he reveals about the deeper situation

## Relationships

- **[House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)**: Official relationship through licensing system; Duke grants permission for forest work in exchange for fees and loyalty
- **[The Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)**: Complicated and often antagonistic; mutual respect for skills combined with philosophical disagreement about the Pact
- **[The Merchant's Collective](/factions/merchants-collective)**: Close partnership; merchants provide capital and markets while Delvers provide forest resources
- **[The Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)**: Often antagonistic; druids view Delvers as exploiting the forest for profit
- **[The City Watch](/factions/city-watch)**: Mixed relationship; Watch enforces laws restricting some Delver activities but appreciates their monster-hunting work
- **[The Temples](/factions/the-temples)**: Limited interaction; some Delvers seek healing or divine protection before dangerous jobs
- **[The Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts)**: Careful avoidance; Delvers know to respect fey territories and avoid provoking supernatural wrath

## Culture and Reputation

### The Delver Lifestyle

Guild members embrace a particular identity:

- **Risk-Taking**: Willingness to face danger for reward
- **Independence**: Preference for self-determination over hierarchy
- **Skill**: Pride in expertise and survival ability
- **Pragmatism**: Focusing on what works rather than ideological purity
- **Camaraderie**: Strong bonds formed through shared danger

This culture attracts those who chafe at conventional structure and prefer proving themselves through action rather than following rules.

### Public Perception

Opinions of Delvers vary:

- **Merchants**: Value Delvers as providers of rare and profitable goods
- **Nobles**: Some view Delvers as useful tools; others see them as uncouth mercenaries
- **Rangers**: Range from respect for skills to contempt for perceived betrayal of sacred duty
- **Druids**: Generally negative, viewing Delvers as exploiters
- **Common Citizens**: Mix of admiration for bravery and suspicion of rough behavior
- **Criminals**: Some connections exist, as both groups operate in gray areas

### Internal Values

Despite rough reputation, the Guild maintains certain standards:

- **Competence**: Members must demonstrate ability to survive dangerous work
- **Reliability**: Contracts once accepted must be completed or valid reason given for failure
- **Loyalty**: Members support each other in dangerous situations
- **Honesty** (Sort of): Lying to clients is bad for business; stretching the truth is expected
- **Respect for Real Danger**: Bravado is common but foolishness is condemned

## Training and Advancement

### Apprenticeship

New members work under experienced Delvers, learning:
- **Survival Skills**: Navigation, tracking, camping, and wilderness living
- **Combat**: Fighting techniques for forest and underground environments
- **Creature Knowledge**: Understanding dangerous animals and monsters
- **Resource Identification**: Recognizing valuable plants, minerals, and materials
- **Risk Assessment**: Judging when a situation is dangerous versus suicidal

### Licensing

Becoming a full licensed Delver requires:
- Demonstrating competence through successful apprentice work
- Paying license fees to House Westmarch
- Passing evaluation by senior guild members
- Understanding Pact restrictions and legal boundaries

### Specialization

Experienced Delvers often specialize in particular areas:
- **Monster Hunting**: Focusing on combat and creature elimination
- **Resource Harvesting**: Expertise in finding and gathering valuable materials
- **Undercroft Navigation**: Specializing in underground exploration
- **Expedition Leadership**: Organizing and leading complex operations

## Equipment and Resources

Delvers invest heavily in equipment:

### Standard Gear

- **Weapons**: Appropriate for fighting in wilderness—bows, spears, swords
- **Armor**: Light enough to maintain mobility but protective enough to matter
- **Survival Tools**: Rope, climbing gear, fire-starting equipment, water purification
- **Navigation**: Maps, compasses, landmark knowledge
- **Lighting**: Lanterns, torches, and occasionally magical illumination

### Specialized Equipment

- **Alchemical Supplies**: Antitoxins, healing potions, acids for obstacle removal
- **Trap Tools**: For both setting and disarming
- **Creature Specific Gear**: Silver weapons, cold iron, holy water, etc.
- **Communication**: Signal devices for coordinating with team members

### Information

Perhaps the most valuable resource is knowledge:
- Maps of forest and Undercroft
- Creature behavior patterns
- Resource location information
- Safe routes and dangerous areas
- Contact networks for selling harvested materials

## Historical Context

The Delver's Guild emerged gradually after [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) established rules for forest access. Initially, resource gathering was handled informally by freelance operators. Over time, these individuals organized for mutual protection and political influence.

Guildmaster Torven professionalized the organization, establishing standards, negotiating formal recognition from House Westmarch, and creating the licensing system. This transition from informal collection of adventurers to recognized organization increased legitimacy while creating tension with those who preferred the old, less regulated approach.

The Guild represents a pragmatic response to the Pact's reality—since absolute preservation is impossible and controlled exploitation is permitted, professionals should handle it rather than amateurs who might cause more damage through incompetence.

## Future Questions

The current crisis forces the Guild to address fundamental questions:

- Can profit-seeking coexist with the supernatural threats emerging from the forest?
- Should Delvers share information about strange occurrences even if it means more restrictions?
- Is independence worth maintaining if cooperation with Rangers might save lives?
- What responsibility do Delvers have beyond completing contracts and making money?
- Can the Guild adapt to threats that transcend simple danger and enter supernatural territory?

How Guildmaster Torven and the Delvers answer these questions may determine whether the Guild remains a marginal organization focused on profit or evolves into something more significant in the city's defense.
