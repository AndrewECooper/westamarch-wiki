# The Circle of the Thornwood

The Circle of the Thornwood is a loose organization of druids, nature clerics, and herbalists who worship Silvanus and serve as intermediaries between civilization and nature. Numbering approximately 30-40 members, the Circle maintains the sacred relationship between [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview) and [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview), ensuring that humanity does not forget its connection to the natural world.

The Circle predates [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), having existed in various forms for centuries. Some members trace their lineage back to druids who served [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) during [the Green War](/lore/the-green-war), carrying knowledge and guilt passed down through generations.

## Role and Responsibilities

The Circle serves several interconnected functions:

- **Spiritual Leadership**: Conducting worship of Silvanus and other nature deities
- **Mediation**: Serving as intermediaries between city and forest, humanity and nature
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintaining understanding of the old ways, forest lore, and ancient traditions
- **Healing**: Providing medicinal herbs, healing magic, and treatment using forest remedies
- **Ritual Observance**: Conducting seasonal ceremonies to maintain balance and honor the natural cycles
- **Advisory**: Offering counsel to [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch) and [the Rangers](/factions/rangers-of-the-green) on matters involving the forest

Unlike [the Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green), who maintain a military structure and patrol the boundary, the Circle focuses on spiritual and diplomatic matters, though the two groups work closely together.

## Goals

The primary objectives of the Circle include:

- Honor Silvanus and maintain the sacred relationship with nature
- Serve as mediators between city and forest
- Preserve knowledge of the old ways
- Provide healing herbs and forest medicines to those in need
- Conduct seasonal rituals to maintain balance
- Ensure humanity remembers its place within the natural order rather than above it

These goals sometimes create tension with those who view the forest as a resource to be exploited or a threat to be controlled rather than a sacred presence to be respected.

## Leadership

### Archdruid Theron Mossbark

**Leader of the Circle** | Wood Elf, age 487 | Located at [the Grove](/locations/thornwood/the-grove) and occasionally the Oak Father's Grove

[Archdruid Theron Mossbark](/characters/npcs/theron-mossbark) is ancient beyond measure. He was young during [the Green War](/lore/the-green-war) but remembers it clearly. He has led the Circle for over two centuries, serving as a living link to the events that shaped the current age.

Recently, Theron has become withdrawn and cryptic. He speaks in riddles, stares into the forest for hours, and sometimes refuses to explain his decisions. Some druids worry about his state of mind; others believe he is sensing something the rest cannot perceive.

Theron was present at [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). He knows the full truth—that [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) was forcibly imprisoned, that [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) was built on deception, that Westmarch is fundamentally a prison. He carries centuries of guilt for his role in these events.

The Archdruid knows the Binding is failing and suspects sabotage, but doesn't know who is responsible. He keeps quiet because revealing the truth could be more dangerous than maintaining silence. He doesn't trust [Lord Brennan Westmarch](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch) and is wary of anyone associated with him.

His motivation centers on protecting the balance, carrying his burden of guilt, and eventually passing the truth to those worthy of it—though he struggles with deciding who is worthy and when the time is right.

## Organization

The Circle maintains a loose, non-hierarchical structure reflecting druidic philosophy that authority comes from wisdom and connection to nature rather than formal rank. However, certain positions exist:

### The Archdruid

The spiritual leader and keeper of the deepest secrets. Currently Theron Mossbark, though succession plans remain unclear given his age and recent behavior.

### Senior Druids

Elder members who lead rituals, teach initiates, and counsel the Archdruid. Several senior druids have expressed concern about Theron's cryptic behavior and wonder if he should begin preparing a successor.

### Initiates

Younger members learning the ways of the Circle through mentorship with senior druids. Training emphasizes not just magical ability but understanding the philosophical relationship between civilization and nature.

### Herbalists and Healers

Members who focus on practical application of forest knowledge—gathering herbs, preparing medicines, treating injuries and illnesses. They serve as the Circle's most visible presence in the city.

### Nature Clerics

Those who approach service to nature through divine rather than primal magic, typically worshipping Silvanus but occasionally other nature deities.

## Headquarters and Sacred Sites

### The Grove

[The Grove](/locations/thornwood/the-grove) is a sacred clearing just outside Westmarch's western wall in the near confines of the Thornwood. It contains standing stones, a natural spring, and ancient trees that were old even before the Green War.

The Circle meets at the Grove for seasonal rituals and major gatherings. The location is also used for important ceremonies such as Ranger oath-taking and druidic initiations. The Grove represents the thin boundary between civilization and wild—close enough to the city to be accessible, but within the forest's embrace.

### The Oak Father's Grove

Within [the Temple Quarter](/locations/westmarch/temple-quarter) stands the Oak Father's Grove, the temple of Silvanus. Unlike traditional stone temples, this structure incorporates living trees, gardens, and herbalist workshops. The Grove serves as the Circle's presence within the city proper, where urban dwellers can access healing and counsel without venturing to the forest boundary.

The Oak Father's Grove includes:

- **The Sacred Grove**: Living trees forming the temple's heart
- **Healing Gardens**: Cultivated herbs and medicinal plants
- **Workshops**: Where herbalists prepare remedies
- **Meeting Chambers**: Rooms built into ancient tree trunks
- **The Root Cellar**: Storage for herbs, seeds, and sacred objects

## Current Status

The Circle faces unprecedented challenges as the forest changes in ways that deeply unsettle even the most experienced druids:

### The Forest's Wrongness

Members report that the Thornwood feels different—more hostile, more aware, more dangerous. Plants grow with unnatural speed. Creatures behave erratically. Areas that were safe for generations now feel threatening.

### Divided Opinions

The Circle is splitting into factions:

- **Traditionalists** believe the Pact must be maintained at all costs, fearing what might happen if it fails
- **Progressives** argue that perhaps the forest's anger is justified and change is necessary
- **The Uncertain** don't know what to believe but sense something fundamental has shifted

Archdruid Theron's cryptic behavior and refusal to provide clear guidance exacerbates these divisions.

### Knowledge and Guilt

Senior druids carry varying levels of knowledge about the true history. Some know parts of the truth; others only suspect. The weight of this knowledge—and the guilt of their predecessors' role in the deception—creates internal conflict about whether to reveal the truth or maintain the secrecy that has lasted 300 years.

### Increased Demand

As strange occurrences increase, more citizens seek the Circle's help—requesting protective herbs, asking for blessings, seeking explanations for nightmares and visions. The Circle struggles to meet this demand while dealing with their own uncertainty.

## Rituals and Practices

### Seasonal Ceremonies

The Circle conducts major rituals at the solstices and equinoxes:

- **Spring Equinox**: Celebrating renewal and planting
- **Summer Solstice**: Honoring growth and abundance
- **Autumn Equinox**: Giving thanks for the harvest
- **Winter Solstice**: Reflecting on death, rest, and the cycle's continuation

These ceremonies take place at [the Grove](/locations/thornwood/the-grove) and are attended by Rangers, some nobles, and citizens who maintain connection to the old ways.

### The Greenwood Blessing

A ritual performed when someone enters the Thornwood for extended periods, asking the forest for safe passage and offering respect to the spirits dwelling within.

### Herbal Preparation

The gathering, drying, and preparation of medicinal herbs follows specific rituals acknowledging the plants' sacrifice and asking permission from the forest before harvesting.

### Initiation Rites

New druids undergo trials in the forest, spending nights alone among the trees to prove their connection to nature and their readiness to serve as intermediaries.

## Relationships

- **[The Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)**: Close cooperative relationship; druids and Rangers work together on forest matters and share some knowledge
- **[House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)**: Respectful but somewhat distant; Archdruid Theron is one of the few who shares knowledge of the Binding with the Duke
- **[The Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts)**: Complex relationship; the Circle understands fey nature better than most humans but fey view them with suspicion due to their role in the Pact's deception
- **[The Temples](/factions/the-temples)**: Generally cooperative, especially with nature-aligned deities; some philosophical differences about humanity's relationship with nature
- **[The City Watch](/factions/city-watch)**: Limited interaction; Watch occasionally consults Circle on forest-related incidents
- **[The Delver's Guild](/factions/delvers-guild)**: Often antagonistic; Circle views Delvers as exploiting the forest for profit
- **Citizens**: Respected by those who maintain traditional beliefs; viewed with suspicion by those who see nature as threatening

## Historical Significance

The Circle's history is deeply intertwined with the events that shaped Westmarch:

### Before the Binding

Druids served the Greenheart and lived in harmony with the forest's consciousness. When the Greenheart awakened and the Green War began, druids found themselves divided—some fought alongside the forest, others recognized the war was unsustainable and sought peace.

### The Binding and Pact

Archdruid Ilmaris, an ancient elf druid (possibly still alive somewhere in the deep Thornwood), negotiated on behalf of the forest during the Greenwood Pact. He did not fully understand he was agreeing to maintain a prison. Other druids participated in the Binding ritual itself, some willingly (seeing no alternative), others coerced.

### The Centuries Since

The Circle has maintained the traditions and knowledge while carrying the burden of what their predecessors did. Each generation, more knowledge is lost or deliberately obscured. The guilt remains.

### The Current Crisis

Now, as the Binding fails, the Circle faces the consequences of the ancient deception. Whether they will reveal the truth, attempt to maintain the status quo, or pursue some other path remains to be seen.

## Philosophy and Teachings

The Circle teaches several core principles:

- **Balance**: Civilization and nature must coexist; neither can dominate without catastrophe
- **Respect**: The forest is not a resource but a living presence deserving reverence
- **Cycles**: Death and renewal, growth and decay—all are necessary and sacred
- **Humility**: Humanity is part of nature, not separate from or superior to it
- **Stewardship**: Those who understand the old ways have responsibility to protect and teach

Recent events test whether these principles can guide the Circle through a crisis that challenges everything they believed about the relationship between humanity and the Thornwood.

## Notable Members

While Archdruid Theron Mossbark leads the Circle, other members include:

- Senior druids who lead seasonal rituals and teach initiates
- Herbalists who maintain the healing gardens and prepare remedies
- Nature clerics who serve Silvanus from a divine rather than primal path
- Initiates learning the ways of the Circle
- Rangers who maintain dual membership, honoring their oath to serve both city and forest

The exact membership remains somewhat fluid, as some druids spend months or years in the deep Thornwood, returning to the city only for major ceremonies.
