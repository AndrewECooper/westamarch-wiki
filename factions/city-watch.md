# The City Watch

The City Watch is Westmarch's law enforcement and city defense force, approximately 400 strong. While [the Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green) patrol the forest boundary, the Watch handles everything within the walls—crime, civil disputes, gate security, and defense of the city proper. They are practical, overworked, and often caught between noble politics and street realities.

Based at [the Watchtower](/locations/westmarch/the-watchtower) in [Oldtown](/locations/westmarch/oldtown), the Watch maintains a visible presence throughout all seven districts of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview), though their resources are constantly stretched thin by the demands of policing a city of 22,000 people.

## Role and Responsibilities

The City Watch serves multiple crucial functions:

- **Law Enforcement**: Investigating crimes, apprehending criminals, and maintaining public order
- **Gate Security**: Manning the city's gates, controlling entry and exit, and preventing smuggling
- **City Defense**: Guarding the walls and responding to external threats
- **Civil Order**: Managing disputes, preventing riots, and maintaining peace during public gatherings
- **Emergency Response**: Responding to fires, building collapses, and other disasters
- **Court Support**: Providing security for trials and enforcing judicial sentences

Unlike military forces that focus on external threats, the Watch deals with the daily reality of urban crime, from petty theft to murder, all while navigating the political complications of a city where noble privilege and street justice often conflict.

## Goals

The primary objectives of the City Watch include:

- Enforce the law and maintain order
- Protect citizens from crime and violence
- Guard the gates and walls
- Investigate crimes and apprehend criminals
- Respond to emergencies and threats

These straightforward goals become complicated in practice, as the Watch must balance enforcing the law equally against political pressure from nobles, managing limited resources, and maintaining morale among troops who see corruption they cannot always address.

## Leadership

### Captain Garrett Stone

**Watch Commander** | Human, age 45 | Based at [the Watchtower](/locations/westmarch/the-watchtower)

[Captain Garrett Stone](/characters/npcs/garrett-stone) is a career soldier who rose through the ranks on merit rather than connections. He is loyal to the city above all else and deeply frustrated by noble politics interfering with his job. Direct, practical, and respected by his troops, Stone runs the Watch with military efficiency.

The Captain knows the official history of Westmarch and [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), but possesses no special knowledge of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) or deeper secrets. However, his meticulous record-keeping has revealed patterns—his records show strange incidents increasing near the western wall for years, though he doesn't understand the supernatural cause.

Captain Stone's primary motivation is simple: keep order, protect citizens, and do his job without political interference. He views the Watch as the thin line between civilization and chaos, and takes that responsibility seriously.

### Lieutenant Kessa Ironfoot

**Second in Command** | Mountain Dwarf, age 89 | Based at [the Watchtower](/locations/westmarch/the-watchtower)

[Lieutenant Kessa Ironfoot](/characters/npcs/kessa-ironfoot) handles the Watch's relationship with [the temples](/factions/the-temples) and manages military matters. A devout follower of Bahamut, she is strict but fair, running operations by the book and expecting the same from those under her command.

Lieutenant Ironfoot brings a military perspective to law enforcement, emphasizing discipline, training, and proper procedure. Her connection to the Platinum Basilica makes her particularly effective at coordinating with the temples on matters requiring both legal and spiritual authority.

Like Captain Stone, she possesses only standard knowledge of Westmarch's history. Her motivations center on upholding the law, serving justice, and honoring Bahamut through righteous service.

## Organization

The Watch is organized into several divisions:

### District Patrols

Each of Westmarch's seven districts has assigned patrol units:

- **[The Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)**: Small elite unit coordinating with ducal guards
- **[Oldtown](/locations/westmarch/oldtown)**: Largest patrol force due to headquarters location
- **[Temple Quarter](/locations/westmarch/temple-quarter)**: Moderate force focusing on protecting religious institutions
- **[Duke's Bridge](/locations/westmarch/dukes-bridge)**: Commercial district patrol handling merchant disputes and theft
- **[The Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens)**: Largest and most challenging patrol area with highest crime rates
- **[The Greenmark](/locations/westmarch/the-greenmark)**: Patrol coordinating with Rangers on border-related issues
- **[Northbank](/locations/westmarch/northbank)**: Small elite unit dealing with wealthy residents

### Gate Guards

Dedicated units manning the city's gates, controlling traffic, collecting tolls, and watching for smugglers and wanted criminals. The eastern gate sees the most traffic, while the northern river docks remain difficult to fully monitor.

### Wall Guards

Troops stationed along the walls, particularly the western wall facing [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview). These guards have recently reported increased strange sounds and sightings from the forest.

### Investigation Division

Experienced Watch members who handle serious crimes requiring detailed investigation. They work closely with [the temples](/factions/the-temples) when crimes involve magical elements.

## Headquarters

The Watch operates from [the Watchtower](/locations/westmarch/the-watchtower), a fortified building in [Oldtown](/locations/westmarch/oldtown) that serves as both headquarters and symbol of legal authority. The building includes:

- **Command Center**: Captain Stone's office and meeting rooms
- **Barracks**: Housing for Watch members on duty
- **Armory**: Weapons and equipment storage
- **Training Yard**: Area for combat practice and drills
- **Cells**: Prison facilities for holding criminals awaiting trial
- **Records Room**: Extensive documentation of crimes, investigations, and patrol reports

The Watchtower also contains secrets: the old cells in the basement include one in the back corner that is never used because it actually provides access to [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft), the city's sewer system. Watch leadership knows about this entrance and occasionally uses it for covert operations or investigations.

Captain Stone's meticulous records, if studied carefully, reveal a pattern of strange incidents near the western wall increasing over years—disappearances, reports of nightmares, unexplained sounds—though he has never understood the supernatural cause underlying these events.

## Current Challenges

The Watch faces numerous difficulties in the current crisis:

### Resource Strain

With approximately 400 members covering a city of 22,000 people across seven districts, the Watch is perpetually understaffed. The recent influx of refugees has exacerbated this problem, increasing both population density and the complexity of maintaining order.

### Political Interference

Noble privilege often conflicts with equal application of law. Watch members must navigate situations where influential people expect preferential treatment, creating tension between doing their duty and avoiding political consequences.

### Increasing Incidents

Strange occurrences near the western wall have increased dramatically over the past year. Watch members respond to reports of nightmares, unusual sounds, and citizens claiming to see things in the darkness. Without understanding the supernatural cause, the Watch struggles to address these incidents effectively.

### The Warrens Crisis

[The Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) experienced the worst of the Gray Morning fog event when an entity emerged from the Undercroft. The Watch responded but faced something beyond their training and equipment. The memory of that incident—and the deaths that resulted—weighs on Watch members who were present.

### Morale Issues

Dealing with daily crime, political pressure, and increasingly strange incidents takes a toll. Some Watch members have requested transfers away from western wall duty, citing nightmares and anxiety. Captain Stone works to maintain discipline and morale but recognizes his troops face challenges they were never trained to handle.

## Equipment and Training

Watch members are equipped with:

- **Standard Gear**: Leather armor, clubs, short swords, and crossbows
- **City Uniform**: Distinctive tabards bearing Westmarch's symbol
- **Whistles**: For calling for backup during emergencies
- **Lanterns**: Essential for night patrols
- **Manacles**: For securing prisoners

Training emphasizes:

- **Urban Combat**: Fighting in confined spaces and crowded streets
- **Investigation**: Evidence collection and witness interviews
- **City Law**: Understanding and properly applying legal codes
- **Crowd Control**: Managing large groups without escalating to violence
- **De-escalation**: Resolving situations without force when possible

Elite units receive additional training in specific areas such as anti-smuggling operations, noble etiquette, or coordination with Rangers on border-related matters.

## Relationships

- **[House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)**: Direct subordination; Captain Stone reports to the ducal court and takes orders from the Duke
- **[The Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)**: Mutual respect between fellow defenders; Rangers handle forest threats while Watch manages city security
- **[The Temples](/factions/the-temples)**: Close cooperation; Lieutenant Ironfoot coordinates with temple leadership, particularly the Platinum Basilica
- **[The Merchant's Collective](/factions/merchants-collective)**: Regular interaction on commercial disputes, theft, and market security
- **[The Delver's Guild](/factions/delvers-guild)**: Sometimes antagonistic; Watch enforces laws that restrict Delver activities
- **Citizens**: Relationship varies by district—generally positive in wealthier areas, more complicated in [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) where poverty creates tension

## Notable Operations

The Watch maintains regular operations and special initiatives:

- **Night Patrols**: Increased presence after dark in high-crime areas
- **Gate Monitoring**: Maintaining lists of wanted criminals and suspicious individuals
- **Market Security**: Preventing theft and fraud during market days
- **Festival Duty**: Managing crowds during religious and civic celebrations
- **Emergency Response**: Quick reaction force for fires and other disasters

Recent operations have increasingly focused on investigating strange occurrences near the western wall and managing refugee settlement in the Warrens.

## Historical Context

The City Watch has served Westmarch for centuries, evolving from a simple militia into a professional law enforcement force. During [the Green War](/lore/the-green-war), the Watch transitioned from peacetime policing to wartime defense, a heritage that still influences their military-style organization.

After the signing of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), the Watch returned to law enforcement duties while maintaining readiness for defense. The recent crisis—with supernatural elements the Watch was never designed to handle—tests whether their traditional approach to maintaining order can adapt to threats beyond the mundane.

Captain Stone occasionally reflects that the Watch was built to handle criminals and riots, not whatever is happening now. His commitment to duty keeps the Watch functional despite facing situations that challenge everything they were trained for.
