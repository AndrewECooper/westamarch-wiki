# The Rangers of the Green

The Rangers of the Green are an elite force of approximately 200 warriors, scouts, and wilderness experts who patrol the boundary between [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview) and [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood/overview). What distinguishes the Rangers from ordinary military forces is their sacred dual oath—they swear to serve both city and forest, making them uniquely positioned as mediators and peacekeepers between civilization and the wild.

Founded shortly after [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) was signed 300 years ago, the Rangers have maintained their vigil for generations, walking the knife's edge between two worlds that often fail to understand each other.

## Role and Responsibilities

The Rangers serve several crucial functions:

- **Border Patrol**: Regular patrols of the boundary and Green Belt to prevent violations of the Pact from either side
- **Protection**: Defending the city from forest threats and the forest from human exploitation
- **Mediation**: Maintaining balance between civilization and wilderness through diplomacy and force when necessary
- **Investigation**: Responding to and investigating disturbances along the border
- **Training**: Instructing new Rangers in the old ways, ensuring knowledge and traditions pass to future generations
- **Stone Guardianship**: Senior Rangers are entrusted with knowledge of and responsibility for certain [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview)

Unlike [the City Watch](/factions/city-watch), who focus on urban law enforcement, the Rangers specialize in wilderness operations, tracking, survival, and understanding the supernatural threats that emerge from the Thornwood.

## Goals

The Rangers' primary objectives include:

- Patrol the boundary and Green Belt to prevent violations of the Greenwood Pact
- Protect the city from forest threats and the forest from human exploitation
- Maintain balance between civilization and wilderness
- Investigate disturbances along the border
- Train new Rangers in the old ways
- Preserve the sacred relationship between humanity and nature

These goals sometimes conflict with each other, requiring Rangers to make difficult decisions about when to prioritize city or forest—a tension built into their very oath.

## Organization and Oath

Upon joining the Rangers, recruits take a sacred dual oath:

*"I swear to serve both city and forest, to walk the boundary between civilization and wild, to protect each from the other and both from those who would bring harm. I am neither servant of stone nor servant of root, but keeper of the balance. This I vow."*

This oath creates a unique position—Rangers answer to [House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch) but also feel responsibility to the forest itself. It grants them authority to act independently when the Pact is threatened, but also creates internal conflicts when city and forest interests diverge.

New Rangers swear their oath at [the Grove](/locations/thornwood/the-grove), the sacred druid clearing just outside the western wall, in a ceremony witnessed by both [the Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood) and representatives of the ducal court.

## Leadership

### High Ranger Mira Thornweaver

**Commander of the Rangers** | Half-elf, age 67 | Based at [the Greenwatch](/locations/westmarch/the-greenwatch)

[High Ranger Mira Thornweaver](/characters/npcs/mira-thornweaver) has served for over forty years and knows the Thornwood better than anyone alive in Westmarch. She has walked every mile of the border, mediated countless disputes, and trained hundreds of Rangers in the skills needed to survive and serve.

Lately, she appears deeply troubled. Rangers report she spends long hours alone in her office, and some have seen her staring at the forest with an expression of worry and conflict. She knows more than she reveals—when she took the position as High Ranger, she was told: "This stone maintains the Pact, protect it at all costs." She suspects there is much more she wasn't told.

High Ranger Mira checks the Northeast Anchor Stone monthly and has noticed the forest has been "wrong" for months. Rangers have gone missing on deep patrols, never to be found. Creatures have become more aggressive without clear cause. She senses systemic failure but doesn't fully understand it.

Her current struggle is deciding when to reveal her concerns without destabilizing the city. She is deeply conflicted between her duty to warn and her fear of causing panic.

## Headquarters

The Rangers are based at [the Greenwatch](/locations/westmarch/the-greenwatch), a fortified compound built into the southern wall of Westmarch in [the Greenmark](/locations/westmarch/the-greenmark) district. The compound includes:

- **Barracks**: Housing for Rangers on rotation from patrol duty
- **Training Grounds**: Areas for combat practice, archery, and wilderness skills training
- **Stables**: For the Rangers' horses and other mounts
- **Command Center**: High Ranger's office and meeting chambers
- **Armory**: Storage for weapons, armor, and specialized gear
- **Watcher's Post**: A secret observation room in the tallest tower containing a magical spyglass and detailed maps of forest activity

The Greenwatch also contains a carefully guarded secret: a tunnel running under the western wall and into the forest. Since the Pact forbids building a western gate, this tunnel allows Rangers to enter and exit the forest for patrols. The tunnel is magically warded to allow only Rangers passage and trigger alarms if others attempt to use it.

## Current Status

The Rangers face their most challenging period since the founding of the order. Over the past year, the situation along the border has deteriorated significantly:

- **Missing Rangers**: Several Rangers have disappeared on deep patrols, their fates unknown
- **Increased Aggression**: Forest creatures attack more frequently and with less provocation
- **Unnatural Growth**: Vegetation in the Green Belt grows faster than normal, requiring constant clearing
- **Strange Occurrences**: Reports of unusual lights in the forest, unexplained sounds, and areas where the forest seems actively hostile
- **Internal Strain**: The dual oath creates tension as some Rangers feel torn between conflicting loyalties

High Ranger Mira advised keeping quiet about the sabotaged Anchor Stone discovered by Ranger patrols, fearing that revealing the truth would destabilize the city. This decision weighs heavily on her, as she knows silence may allow the situation to worsen.

The Rangers continue their patrols and maintain the boundary, but morale is strained and many sense that something fundamental has changed in the forest.

## Recruitment and Training

Rangers are recruited from volunteers who demonstrate exceptional wilderness skills, combat ability, and most importantly, respect for both civilization and nature. Many come from families with Ranger traditions, though the order accepts anyone who can meet the demanding standards.

Training is rigorous and can take years:

- **Wilderness Survival**: Navigation, tracking, foraging, and survival in hostile environments
- **Combat Skills**: Proficiency with bows, blades, and fighting in forest terrain
- **Forest Lore**: Understanding the plants, animals, and supernatural inhabitants of the Thornwood
- **Pact Knowledge**: Education in the history and terms of the Greenwood Pact
- **Diplomacy**: Learning to mediate between human and forest interests
- **Secret Knowledge**: Senior Rangers learn the location and significance of certain Anchor Stones

Only after completing training and demonstrating readiness does a recruit take the dual oath and become a full Ranger.

## Relationships

- **[House Westmarch](/factions/house-westmarch)**: The Rangers answer to the Duke but maintain significant operational independence; High Ranger Mira coordinates directly with Duke Aldric
- **[The Circle of the Thornwood](/factions/circle-of-the-thornwood)**: Close cooperative relationship; druids and Rangers often work together on forest matters
- **[The City Watch](/factions/city-watch)**: Mutual respect between fellow defenders; Rangers handle forest threats while the Watch manages city security
- **[The Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts)**: Complex relationship defined by the Pact; Rangers mediate between fey and humans but tensions exist
- **[The Delver's Guild](/factions/delvers-guild)**: Complicated and sometimes antagonistic; Rangers enforce Pact restrictions that Delvers see as limiting profitable opportunities
- **[The Temples](/factions/the-temples)**: Cooperative relationship, particularly with the Oak Father's Grove; many Rangers worship Silvanus

## Historical Significance

The Rangers were established shortly after the signing of the Greenwood Pact to serve as living embodiments of the treaty's promise—that humanity and forest could coexist in balance. The First Rangers included veterans of [the Green War](/lore/the-green-war) who had fought on the front lines and understood both the danger the Greenheart posed and the cost of the war fought to contain it.

These founding members, working with druids and fey mediators, created the traditions and training methods that persist to this day. Their insistence on the dual oath—serving both city and forest rather than one or the other—reflects the hard-won wisdom that peace requires understanding and respecting both sides.

For three centuries, the Rangers have maintained their vigil, preventing small conflicts from escalating and keeping the boundary secure. The current crisis tests whether their traditions and oath can endure when the fundamental assumptions of the Pact begin to fail.

## Notable Traditions

- **The Border Walk**: Every Ranger must walk the entire boundary at least once, learning every Border Stone and landmark
- **The Night of Silence**: An annual ceremony where Rangers spend one night alone in the forest without weapons, demonstrating trust in the Pact
- **The Green Cord**: Rangers wear a braided green cord on their uniform, symbolizing their connection to the forest
- **The Keeper's Burden**: Senior Rangers who know about the Anchor Stones call themselves "Keepers" and bear the weight of secret knowledge
