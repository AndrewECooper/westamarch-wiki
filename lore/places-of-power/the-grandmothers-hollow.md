# The Grandmother's Hollow

The Grandmother's Hollow is a [Place of Power](/lore/places-of-power/overview) deep in the Thornwood where [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) accumulated memory—millennia of knowledge, the wisdom of ages, the recollection of everything the forest has witnessed—manifests most strongly. This place is ruled by a coven of hags who are parasites, feeding on the Greenheart's dreams and memories while it sleeps, trading stolen recollections and forgotten knowledge to those desperate or foolish enough to seek them out.

## Aspect of the Greenheart

**Memory / Knowledge**

The Grandmother's Hollow is where the Greenheart's memories are most accessible, most tangible. Millennia of accumulated knowledge, every moment witnessed by the forest, every cycle of growth and decay—all of it exists here in physical form, preserved like insects in amber.

## Connection to the Binding

The Grandmother's Hollow is sympathetically connected to the [Archive Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/archive-stone) beneath the Archive of Ioun in Westmarch's Temple Quarter. The Archive Stone suppresses the Greenheart's memory by targeting this place, preventing the primordial spirit from accessing its own past.

Without memory, the Greenheart cannot recall what it once was, what was done to it, or how to respond. It is lost in an eternal present, severed from its own identity.

## Physical Description

### The Ancient Tree

- A truly massive tree, among the oldest in the Thornwood
- Bark blackened and split, like old skin
- Roots form a vast network around the area
- The trunk is hollow—hence the name
- Inside, the hollow descends deep underground

### The Hollow Itself

- Vast cavern beneath the ancient tree
- Walls lined with roots that pulse faintly
- Strange growths hang from the ceiling—fungal, but wrong
- The floor is covered in:
  - Moss that glows with faint bioluminescence
  - Pools of dark water that never ripple
  - Objects embedded in the earth itself
- Air is thick, musty, with a sweet-rot smell
- Temperature is constant, cool but not cold

### The Memory Manifestations

Throughout the hollow, memories exist in physical form:

- **Frozen moments** preserved in amber-like resin
  - Scenes from millennia past visible within
  - Trees as they were ages ago
  - Creatures long extinct
  - Battles, deaths, births—all captured
- **Crystallized thoughts** growing like minerals
  - Touch them and feel alien knowledge
  - Understand things you shouldn't know
  - Risk your mind breaking from incomprehensible information
- **Root networks** that store information
  - Similar to the mycelial networks of the Greenheart itself
  - Can be "read" by those who know how
  - Dangerous—might trap your consciousness

### The Atmosphere

- Heavy feeling of age, of time compressed
- Sounds echo strangely, as if multiple times are overlapping
- Vision occasionally blurs—you might see the past and present simultaneously
- Strong sense of being remembered even as you observe

## The Hag Coven

The hollow is ruled by a coven of hags—three (or possibly more) ancient beings who are parasites feeding on the Greenheart's sleeping mind:

### What They Are

- **Not servants of the Greenheart**—they are parasites
- Feed on the Greenheart's dreams and memories while it sleeps
- Grown fat on stolen recollections over centuries
- Each hag embodies a different aspect of corrupted memory:
  - One might deal in forgotten names
  - One in stolen moments
  - One in futures that never happened

### What They Know

The hags know things no mortal should know:

- Secrets from before human civilization
- Every violation of the Greenwood Pact
- The true names of things best forgotten
- How the Binding was created
- Where every Anchor Stone is located
- What the Greenheart dreams about

### What They Trade

The hags trade in knowledge and memory:

**They Might Offer:**
- Information about the Binding
- Locations of Places of Power
- Secrets about conspirators
- Knowledge of how to repair Anchor Stones
- Visions of possible futures

**They Demand as Payment:**
- Your own memories (stolen, leaving gaps in your past)
- Someone else's secrets (requiring betrayal)
- Future favors (to be called in at worst moments)
- Your name (giving them power over you)
- Years of your life
- Something precious to you that you don't know is precious yet

### Their Nature

- Cruel but not mindlessly evil
- Enjoy causing psychological harm
- Take pleasure in corrupted bargains
- Might tell the truth, but never the whole truth
- See mortals as amusing toys
- Genuinely don't care if the Greenheart wakes—they'll feed either way

## Dangers

Visiting the Grandmother's Hollow presents multiple threats:

### The Hags Themselves

- Powerful magic users
- Centuries of experience manipulating mortals
- Home ground advantage
- Can trap you in memories
- Might decide you're more valuable as a permanent source of memories

### The Memories

- Touching memory manifestations can trap your consciousness
- Experiencing the Greenheart's memories directly risks madness
- Some memories are of things that shouldn't be remembered
- You might forget who you are while experiencing something else

### Environmental Hazards

- Easy to become lost in time
- Some areas trap you in repeating moments
- The hollow itself is alive and aware
- Roots might entangle those who disrespect the place

### The Price of Knowledge

- Even if you successfully trade with the hags, the price lingers
- Memories they take leave holes that never quite fill
- Knowledge they give you might come with compulsions
- You might find yourself doing things you don't remember agreeing to

## Thematic Core

The Grandmother's Hollow embodies interconnected themes:

### Corruption of Wisdom

- Knowledge without context
- Memory divorced from meaning
- Wisdom preserved but twisted
- The difference between knowing and understanding

### Memory as Identity

- What are you without your memories?
- Can knowledge stolen be truly known?
- The horror of forgetting pieces of yourself
- Memories that don't belong to you changing who you are

### Deals with Terrible Prices

- Getting what you want at a cost you didn't understand
- Wisdom that makes you wish you didn't know
- The temptation to trade something precious for something necessary
- Realizing too late what you've lost

## Source Material for Repair

If the [Archive Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/archive-stone) were damaged, repairing it would require Source Material from the Grandmother's Hollow:

### What Might Be Needed

- A memory crystal containing ancient knowledge
- Root fibers from the tree itself
- Water from the dark pools that hold reflections of the past
- Something more abstract—a forgotten name, a stolen moment

### Obtaining It

The hags would demand payment:
- They might trade fairly if you have something interesting enough
- Or they might decide taking from them requires a higher price
- Either way, you leave changed

## Strategic Value

Despite the dangers, the Grandmother's Hollow has value:

### Information Source

- The hags know the locations of other Places of Power
- They understand how the Binding works
- They might know Verdanthis's plans
- They can reveal hidden conspirators

### Ritual Location

- The concentrated memory makes it powerful for certain rituals
- Divination magic is stronger here
- Might be used to recover lost knowledge
- Could potentially access the Greenheart's memories directly

### Bargaining Chip

- The hags have their own agenda
- They might trade information about the conspiracy
- Could potentially be turned against Verdanthis
- Or they might betray you to her if she offers something better

## If the Greenheart Wakes

If the Binding fails and the Greenheart fully awakens, the Grandmother's Hollow would transform:

### The Memories Return

- All stolen memories rush back to the Greenheart
- The hags might be consumed or expelled
- The hollow becomes even more dangerous
- Past and present might literally overlap

### The Greenheart Remembers

- Three hundred years of imprisonment come flooding back
- It remembers exactly what was done to it
- It remembers who imprisoned it
- It remembers every violation of the Pact
- **And it will act on those memories**

### A Place of Revenge

The hollow might become:
- A planning center for the Greenheart's retaliation
- A place where those who wronged the forest face judgment
- A library of crimes recorded over centuries
- A manifestation of the Greenheart's rage

## Approaching the Hags

If the party must deal with the hag coven, considerations:

### Preparation

- Bring something interesting to trade (knowledge, secrets, unique items)
- Understand what you're willing to lose
- Have clear, specific questions
- Establish limits before you go—and stick to them
- Bring someone to keep you honest

### Negotiation

- Be respectful but not submissive
- The hags respect cleverness and despise weakness
- Every word matters in a bargain
- Get terms clearly stated before agreeing
- Assume they're tricking you and plan accordingly

### Walking Away

- You can leave if the price is too high
- The hags might let you go (they enjoy anticipation)
- Or they might not
- Know when knowledge isn't worth the cost
