# The Singing Pools

The Singing Pools are a [Place of Power](/lore/places-of-power/overview) deep in the Thornwood where [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) power of perception manifests most strongly. The waters here show visions because they are connected to the Greenheart's sight. When the Greenheart was active, it could see through every pool, every dewdrop, every still water in the Thornwood. Now these pools stand silent but watching, waiting for the Greenheart to wake and look through them once more.

## Aspect of the Greenheart

**Sight / Perception**

The Singing Pools are the Greenheart's sensorium—its eyes and ears. This is where the primordial spirit's ability to perceive the world is most concentrated. The pools themselves are organs of perception, windows through which the vast consciousness can observe reality.

## Connection to the Binding

The Singing Pools are sympathetically connected to the [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) beneath [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) in Westmarch. The Warren Stone suppresses the Greenheart's perception by targeting this place, preventing the spirit from seeing through the waters.

With the Warren Stone damaged, the Greenheart begins to perceive dimly—not full awareness, but flickering, confused impressions. The unnatural fog in the Warrens is a manifestation of this partially restored sight bleeding into Westmarch.

## Physical Description

### The Location

- Deep in the Thornwood, multiple days journey from Westmarch
- A series of interconnected pools in a natural amphitheater of stone
- Surrounded by ancient trees that seem to lean in, watching
- The air is unusually still—no wind reaches this place
- Everything feels observed

### The Pools Themselves

- Crystal-clear water of unusual depth
- Surfaces perfectly still, like mirrors
- Each pool shows different visions when observed
- The water "sings" with faint harmonics—the source of the name
- Stone formations around the pools appear natural but have strange patterns
- Moss and lichens grow in spirals and geometric shapes

### The Atmosphere

- Heavy sense of being watched
- Sounds seem muted, distant
- Vision occasionally blurs at the edges
- Reality feels thin here, as if you could see through it to something beyond
- Those who stare into the pools too long feel something staring back

## The Visions

The pools show visions to those who look into them:

### What They Show

- Past events in the Thornwood
- Current events happening elsewhere in the forest
- Occasionally glimpses of the future (unreliable, fragmentary)
- The Green War as the Greenheart perceived it
- Westmarch from impossible angles
- Things watching you that you cannot see

### The Danger

- The visions are addictive—those who watch feel compelled to keep watching
- Prolonged exposure risks losing yourself in what you see
- Some visions are so alien that mortal minds struggle to process them
- You might see things you shouldn't know
- Something might see you through the pools

### Source of the Visions

When the Greenheart was active, these pools were its eyes. Now, with the Greenheart sleeping:
- The pools retain fragments of past sight
- Show echoes of what the Greenheart once perceived
- With the Warren Stone damaged, new visions are beginning to form
- If the Greenheart fully wakes, these pools will become its active senses again

## Inhabitants and Guardians

The Singing Pools are not uninhabited:

### Possible Guardians

- **Water elementals** drawn to the magical pools
- **Fey creatures** who serve or once served the Greenheart
- **Awakened animals** who come here to drink and gain strange wisdom
- **Things that were once people** who looked too long and couldn't look away

### The Watching Presence

Those who visit the pools report feeling watched by something vast:
- Not hostile, exactly, but utterly alien
- Patient beyond mortal comprehension
- Perceiving you as you perceive it
- This is the Greenheart's sleeping perception, still faintly aware

## The Source Stone

**Status: RETRIEVED**

The Source Stone needed to repair the [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) has been retrieved from the Singing Pools:

### What Was Taken

- Stone from the pool's edge, inscribed with natural patterns
- Contains sympathetic resonance with the Warren Stone
- Necessary component for physical repair
- The act of taking it may have been noticed

### Consequences of Removal

Taking material from a Place of Power is not without consequence:
- The pools may have reacted to the removal
- Guardians may have been alerted
- The Greenheart's dreaming perception may have noticed
- Verdanthis's forces might investigate who took it

## Dangers

Visiting the Singing Pools presents multiple dangers:

### Environmental Hazards

- Easy to become lost in visions
- Time behaves strangely—hours feel like minutes
- Drinking the water has unpredictable effects
- Touching the water creates sympathetic connection to the Greenheart's perception

### Active Threats

- Guardians who protect the pools
- Creatures drawn to the concentrated magic
- Verdanthis's forces if they learn of your presence
- The pools themselves if they perceive you as a threat

### Psychological Dangers

- Visions that break your mind
- Seeing things about yourself you didn't want to know
- Learning truths you cannot unlearn
- Forming connection to the Greenheart through prolonged exposure

## Thematic Core

The Singing Pools embody several interconnected themes:

### Observation and Surveillance

- The pools watch—they are inherently voyeuristic
- Nothing in the Thornwood is truly hidden from them
- Being perceived by something so vast and alien
- The violation of being seen by something that doesn't understand privacy

### The Weight of Sight

- Knowing things you cannot unknow
- Seeing the world as the Greenheart sees it—alien and incomprehensible
- The burden of perception without the ability to look away
- Understanding that you are always, always being watched

### Reflection and Truth

- The pools show truth, but truth filtered through inhuman perception
- What you see might be real, but is it reality as you understand it?
- Your reflection in the water might show you as you truly are—or as the forest sees you

## Uses and Value

Despite the dangers, the Singing Pools have value:

### Information Gathering

- The visions can reveal information impossible to obtain otherwise
- Past events can be witnessed
- Current events across the forest can be observed
- But trust nothing you see without corroboration

### Ritual Components

- Water from the pools has powerful magical properties
- Can be used in divination rituals
- Might enhance scrying or perception magic
- But carries risk of unwanted connection to the Greenheart

### Strategic Location

- Understanding what the pools show helps understand how the Greenheart perceives
- If the Binding fails, knowing the pools' location might be strategically critical
- Could potentially be used to blind the Greenheart again if necessary

## If the Greenheart Wakes

If the Binding fails and the Greenheart fully awakens, the Singing Pools would become:

- **Active sensory organs** through which it sees the entire Thornwood
- **Command centers** for coordinating forest forces
- **Communication hubs** where its will becomes visible
- **Portals of perception** showing everything happening in its domain

The Greenheart would see through every drop of water in the forest, but the Singing Pools would be where its sight is sharpest, clearest, most focused.
