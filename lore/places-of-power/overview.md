# Places of Power in the Thornwood

The Places of Power are locations deep in the Thornwood Forest where specific aspects of [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) power manifest most strongly. Each Place of Power is sympathetically connected to one of the [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) beneath Westmarch, creating a magical link that enables [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) to function.

## How Places of Power Work

### Sympathetic Connection

Each [Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) doesn't simply suppress the Greenheart in a general sense—it binds a **specific aspect** of the Greenheart's power by targeting the place in the Thornwood where that aspect manifests most strongly.

The key principle: **Each Anchor Stone is sympathetically connected to its corresponding Place of Power. The stone doesn't draw energy from the place—it suppresses the power that emanates from it.**

### What Happens When Stones Are Damaged

When an Anchor Stone is damaged, that aspect of the Greenheart begins to stir, and its corresponding Place of Power becomes more active:

- The suppression weakens
- The power emanating from the Place intensifies
- Strange phenomena manifest in Westmarch near the damaged stone
- The Greenheart begins to express that aspect of its nature

### Repair Requirements

Because each Anchor Stone is sympathetically linked to a specific Place of Power, **repairing a damaged stone requires Source Material from that location**.

For example:
- The [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) requires stone from [The Singing Pools](/lore/places-of-power/the-singing-pools)
- Other stones would require materials from their connected places of power

This requirement creates a dangerous necessity: to repair the Binding, heroes must venture deep into the Thornwood to retrieve materials from places that actively embody the Greenheart's power.

## The Six Places of Power

Each Place of Power corresponds to one of the six outer Anchor Stones (the seventh stone, the [Central Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/central-stone), connects directly to the Heartwood Sanctuary itself):

### 1. [The Singing Pools](/lore/places-of-power/the-singing-pools)
- **Aspect:** Sight / Perception
- **Connected Stone:** [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone)
- **Nature:** The Greenheart's sensorium—waters that show visions
- **Status:** Source Stone retrieved

### 2. [The Grandmother's Hollow](/lore/places-of-power/the-grandmothers-hollow)
- **Aspect:** Memory / Knowledge
- **Connected Stone:** [Archive Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/archive-stone)

- **Inhabitants:** A coven of hags feeding on stolen recollections

### 3. [The Chorus Grove](/lore/places-of-power/the-chorus-grove)
- **Aspect:** Voice / Command
- **Connected Stone:** [Greenwatch Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/greenwatch-stone)

### 5. [The Maw](/lore/places-of-power/the-maw)
- **Aspect:** Hunger / Consumption
- **Connected Stone:** [Duke's Bridge Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/dukes-bridge-stone)

### 6. [The Drowning Glade](/lore/places-of-power/the-drowning-glade)
- **Aspect:** Dream / Influence
- **Connected Stone:** [Northbank Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/northbank-stone)
- **Nature:** Beautiful but deadly—those who sleep here never wake

## Characteristics of Places of Power

All Places of Power share certain characteristics:

### Supernatural Nature
- Not ordinary forest locations
- Manifest specific aspects of the Greenheart's nature in concentrated form
- Reality behaves differently in these places
- Dangerous even with the Greenheart sleeping

### Active Even While Bound
- Continue to function even with the Greenheart imprisoned
- Reduced in power but not eliminated
- Like organs continuing to function in a comatose body
- Would become exponentially more dangerous if the Greenheart woke

### Guardians and Inhabitants
- Often inhabited by creatures aligned with that aspect of power
- Some inhabitants may be:
  - Servants of the Greenheart
  - Parasites feeding on its power
  - Creatures drawn to the concentrated magic
  - Things born from the Greenheart's dreams

### Thematic Manifestation
- Each place embodies its aspect in both literal and metaphorical ways
- The Maw physically consumes, but also represents the patient hunger of nature
- The Drowning Glade literally drowns you in dreams, but also represents seductive influence
- Understanding the theme helps navigate the dangers

## Strategic Importance

The Places of Power represent both threat and opportunity:

### As Threats
- Dangerous locations that could produce spawn
- Sources of supernatural phenomena
- Places where the Greenheart's power is concentrated
- If the Binding fails completely, these become command centers

### As Resources
- Source of materials needed to repair Anchor Stones
- Places where the Greenheart's nature can be studied
- Potential locations for ritual work
- Understanding them helps understand the Binding

### As Adventure Sites
- Each Place of Power is a distinct location with unique challenges
- Retrieving materials requires confronting the nature of that power
- Success means gaining resources to save Westmarch
- Failure could mean strengthening what you're trying to contain

## The Moral Question

The Places of Power raise uncomfortable questions about the Binding:

- These are natural expressions of the Greenheart's being
- By suppressing them, the Binding doesn't just imprison—it denies the Greenheart's nature
- Each place represents a fundamental aspect of what the Greenheart is
- Binding all six means suppressing the Greenheart's entire identity

Is this justice or cruelty? That question echoes through every expedition to these places.

## Navigating the Thornwood

Reaching any Place of Power requires:

### Journey
- 100+ miles into the deep Thornwood
- Multiple days of travel
- Navigation through hostile terrain
- The forest actively resists intrusion

### Survival
- Dangerous creatures throughout the journey
- Fey who may or may not be hostile
- Environmental hazards
- The forest's awakening makes travel more dangerous

### Guides
- Local knowledge essential
- Rangers might know rough locations
- Fey might trade information
- Druids might have maps or records

### Consequences
- Every expedition risks discovery by Verdanthis's forces
- Success attracts attention
- The act of taking materials might anger the forest
- Some inhabitants might follow you back
