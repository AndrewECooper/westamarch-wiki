# The Drowning Glade

The Drowning Glade is a [Place of Power](/lore/places-of-power/overview) deep in the Thornwood where [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) ability to reach into sleeping minds—to send dreams, influence thoughts, and touch the consciousness of mortals—manifests most strongly. This is a beautiful, peaceful clearing with a still pool at its center, but those who sleep here never wake, trapped in endless dreams where the Greenheart's sleeping mind bleeds into their own. The boundary between sleep and death blurs in this place.

## Aspect of the Greenheart

**Dream / Influence**

The Drowning Glade is where the Greenheart's ability to touch mortal consciousness is concentrated. This is the most insidious of its powers—the ability to reach into sleeping minds, to plant ideas that feel like your own thoughts, to show visions that seem like revelation, to call mortals to the forest with dreams they cannot resist.

## Connection to the Binding

The Drowning Glade is sympathetically connected to the [Northbank Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/northbank-stone) beneath Lord Brennan's estate in Westmarch's Northbank district. The Northbank Stone suppresses the Greenheart's dream influence by targeting this place, preventing the primordial spirit from reaching into mortal minds.

**Current Status:** Lord Brennan has been deliberately damaging the Northbank Stone for months, causing nightmares to spread through Westmarch's western districts as the Drowning Glade's power bleeds through.

## Physical Description

### The Glade Itself

The Drowning Glade appears deceptively peaceful:

- A perfect circle of ancient trees forming a natural clearing
- Soft grass and wildflowers covering the ground
- Dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy
- The air is still, quiet, peaceful
- Everything about it invites rest

It is perhaps the most beautiful place in the Thornwood. That beauty is a trap.

### The Pool

At the center of the glade is a still pool:

- Perfectly circular, roughly 20 feet across
- Water so still it resembles polished glass
- Depth impossible to determine—it might be shallow or bottomless
- Surface reflects the sky with perfect clarity
- No ripples, ever, even when wind blows
- Looking into it makes you drowsy

### The Sleepers

Throughout the glade, arranged in peaceful repose:

- Bodies that appear to be sleeping
- Some recent, some ancient—preserved by the glade's power
- All with expressions of peaceful contentment
- No decay, no signs of death
- Chests still rise and fall with slow breaths
- But they never wake

Some have been here for:
- Days—recent travelers who made camp
- Months—explorers who never returned
- Years—Rangers who disappeared on patrol
- Decades—people from the Green War
- Centuries—druids or fey from before human civilization

### The Atmosphere

The glade has a powerful, seductive quality:

- Everything here wants you to rest
- The grass is soft, inviting you to lie down
- The sunlight is warm but not too warm
- The air smells of flowers and peace
- Sounds are muted, gentle, lulling
- Even brief visits make you feel exhausted
- Resisting sleep requires increasing willpower

## The Nature of the Dreams

Those who sleep in the Drowning Glade don't simply rest—they drown in dreams:

### What They Dream

The dreams are beautiful at first:

- Visions of the forest in primordial glory
- Sense of connection to something vast and ancient
- Feeling of peace and acceptance
- Understanding of nature's cycles
- Freedom from mortal concerns and fears

But the dreams don't end:

- They go deeper, further
- You lose track of who you are
- The Greenheart's sleeping mind mingles with yours
- You experience being the forest
- Your individual consciousness dissolves
- You become part of something greater—and are lost

### The Greenheart's Dreams

The dreams come from the Greenheart's sleeping mind:

- Three hundred years of forced dormancy
- Confusion about what happened
- Anger at imprisonment
- Longing for freedom
- Memories of the forest before civilization
- Dreams of what it would do if it woke

Those who sleep here don't just dream their own dreams—they dream the Greenheart's dreams, and those dreams are too vast for mortal minds.

### Why They Don't Wake

The sleepers are trapped:

- Not physically held
- Not magically bound in traditional sense
- Simply cannot find their way back to waking
- Lost in infinite dream space
- Individual consciousness dissolved
- Still alive but no longer themselves

Waking them would require:

- Breaking the dream connection
- Powerful magic to pull consciousness back
- Strong personal anchor to their identity
- Someone who knows them calling them back
- Or destroying what creates the dreams

## Inhabitants and Guardians

The Drowning Glade is inhabited by things born from dreams:

### Nightmare Creatures

Beings that should not exist:

- Things from the Greenheart's dreams given form
- Creatures that are half-real, half-dream
- Change appearance based on who's observing
- Might be beautiful or terrifying or both
- Defend the glade from those who would wake the sleepers

### Fey Driven Mad

Some fey are drawn to the glade:

- Attracted by the concentrated dream power
- Stay too long and lose themselves
- Half-mad from proximity to the Greenheart's dreaming
- Might help or hinder visitors unpredictably
- Speak in riddles and fragments of dreams
- Confuse dream and reality

### The Dream Guardian

There might be a single entity that watches over the glade:

- Could be a powerful fey
- Might be a spirit of sleep itself
- Possibly a mortal who slept here so long they became something else
- Whatever it is, it ensures the sleepers are not disturbed
- Views the endless dreams as mercy, not curse
- Might be hostile to those who try to wake the sleepers

### The Almost-Woken

Some sleepers are partially aware:

- Move in their sleep
- Speak fragments of dreams
- Respond to stimuli without waking
- Dangerous—they might pull others into dreams
- Tragic—they're aware enough to know they're trapped

## Dangers

The Drowning Glade presents unique dangers:

### The Pull to Sleep

The primary danger is simply being there:

- Overwhelming desire to rest
- The longer you stay, the harder to resist
- Eventually, you will sleep
- Once asleep, you might never wake

### Dream Invasion

Even without sleeping:

- The boundary between waking and dreaming blurs
- You might see things that aren't there
- Hear voices that shouldn't exist
- Experience others' dreams bleeding into your perception
- Risk losing grip on what's real

### The Sleepers Themselves

Those already trapped might:

- Unknowingly pull others into dreams
- Share nightmares with nearby people
- Create dangerous dream-constructs
- Spread the sleep effect

### The Guardians

Whatever protects the glade:

- Might view visitors as threats
- Could force sleep on those who resist
- Might trap you in dreams deliberately
- Could show you visions that break your mind

## Thematic Core

The Drowning Glade embodies interconnected themes:

### Beauty That Kills

- The most dangerous trap is the one that looks safe
- Seduction is more effective than force
- The glade isn't evil—it's simply what it is
- Sometimes the most peaceful rest is death

### Dreams You Can't Escape

- Loss of control over your own consciousness
- Being trapped in your own mind
- Dreams that feel better than reality
- The seductive pull of eternal rest

### The Seductive Pull of Endless Sleep

- Rest from struggle
- Peace from worry
- Freedom from mortality's burdens
- But at the cost of everything you are

## Source Material for Repair

To repair the [Northbank Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/northbank-stone), Source Material from the Drowning Glade is required:

### What Might Be Needed

- Water from the central pool
- Flowers that grow only in the glade
- Something from one of the sleepers (hair, tear, breath)
- A captured dream given physical form
- Permission from the Dream Guardian

### Obtaining It

The challenges:

- Resisting the pull to sleep long enough to gather material
- Not disturbing the sleepers
- Dealing with guardians
- Escaping before you're trapped
- Not bringing the dreams back with you

## Current Connection to Westmarch

With Lord Brennan sabotaging the [Northbank Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/northbank-stone), the Drowning Glade's power is bleeding into Westmarch:

### The Nightmares

People in western Westmarch, especially near Northbank, report:

- Dreams of the forest calling them
- Compulsion to walk toward the Thornwood
- Nightmares of drowning in green
- Waking up exhausted as if they didn't sleep
- Some sleepwalk toward the walls

### The Sensitive

Those most affected:

- Druids experience the dreams intensely
- Fey become agitated by the bleeding dream power
- Nature-sensitive individuals (like Quill) feel it strongly
- Children seem particularly susceptible
- Some people report hearing whispers

### The Trail of Evidence

The concentration of nightmares:

- Strongest near Northbank
- Began several months ago (when Brennan started sabotage)
- Increasing in intensity
- Pattern points toward Brennan's estate
- Could lead investigators to discover his betrayal

## Strategic Implications

### As a Threat

If the Northbank Stone fails completely:

- Everyone within miles dreams the Greenheart's dreams
- Some would never wake
- Others would wake changed—carrying fragments of the Greenheart's consciousness
- Westmarch's population partially controlled through dreams
- The Greenheart could recruit agents without even being fully awake

### As Intelligence

The glade offers dangerous knowledge:

- The sleepers dream the Greenheart's dreams
- Those dreams might reveal its plans, fears, memories
- Could learn about the Binding from the Greenheart's perspective
- But accessing that knowledge requires entering the dreams—and risking being trapped

### Waking the Sleepers

Attempting to wake the sleepers:

- Might break the glade's power temporarily
- Could provide witnesses to the Greenheart's nature
- Some might have knowledge from before the Binding
- But might also release their accumulated dreams with catastrophic effect

## If the Greenheart Wakes

If the Binding fails and the Greenheart fully awakens, the Drowning Glade would transform:

### Active Dream Invasion

- The Greenheart would use the glade to reach every mortal mind for miles
- Dreams become commands
- Some mortals would become puppets
- Others would join the Greenheart willingly, seduced by beautiful dreams

### The Sleepers Rise

The ancient sleepers might:

- Wake under the Greenheart's control
- Have absorbed three centuries of its dreams
- Serve as priests or prophets
- Spread the dream-influence further

### Expansion

- The dream effect might spread beyond the glade
- Multiple drowning glades could form
- Eventually, sleeping anywhere near the Thornwood becomes dangerous

## Experiencing the Glade

If the party visits the Drowning Glade:

### What They Might Witness

- Heartbreaking beauty that invites rest
- Sleepers trapped in peaceful repose for centuries
- The seductive pull to simply lie down and rest
- Dreams bleeding into waking reality
- The fine line between sleep and death

### What They Might Learn

- The Greenheart's dream influence is subtle and terrifying
- This power currently bleeding into Westmarch due to Brennan's sabotage
- Some dreams are too vast for mortal minds
- The most dangerous traps look like peace

### What They Might Feel

- Exhaustion and desire to rest
- Sympathy for those trapped
- Horror at the seductive nature of the trap
- Understanding of why the Northbank Stone must be repaired
- Fear of what happens if this power reaches everyone in Westmarch

## The Moral Complexity

The Drowning Glade raises uncomfortable questions:

- The sleepers appear peaceful, content
- Are they suffering or experiencing eternal bliss?
- Is waking them mercy or cruelty?
- They're alive but not living—is that better or worse than death?
- The Greenheart isn't deliberately cruel—this is its nature
- Is suppressing this aspect of its being justified?

The glade offers no easy answers, just beautiful, deadly peace.
