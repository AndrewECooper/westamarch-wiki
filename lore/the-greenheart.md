# The Greenheart

The Greenheart is a **primordial nature spirit**—a distributed consciousness that exists throughout the entire [Thornwood Forest](/locations/thornwood). It is not a single tree or creature, but rather an emergent intelligence arising from the forest ecosystem itself. Three hundred years ago, the kingdom did not negotiate peace with this entity—it imprisoned a god.

## Nature and Origin

The Greenheart is an ancient being that predates human civilization by millennia. It is fundamentally a massive mycelial network given sapience, with every tree, plant, and natural creature in the Thornwood forming part of its "body." It perceives through the forest and can exert will through it, experiencing reality in ways mortals cannot fully comprehend.

### Key Characteristics

- **A massive mycelial network given sapience** — The Greenheart exists as a distributed consciousness throughout the forest's fungal networks
- **Every tree, plant, and natural creature in the Thornwood is part of its "body"** — The forest itself is the physical manifestation of this entity
- **It perceives through the forest and can exert will through it** — Where the forest grows, the Greenheart sees and acts
- **Age: Predates human civilization by millennia** — This entity existed long before the first human settlements
- **Not evil, but fundamentally incompatible with civilization** — It sees cities, farms, and roads as wounds on the natural world
- **Extremely slow thinking** — When awake, it perceives time differently; years to it are like days to mortals
- **Cyclical worldview** — Life, death, growth, decay are all natural; civilization disrupts these cycles by preserving, controlling, and expanding

## Capabilities When Active

When the Greenheart is awake and functioning at full power, it possesses abilities that make it a force of nature in the most literal sense:

### Creation and Command

- **Can create spawn** — When active, it awakens the forest to create protectors: treants, blights, awakened animals, and stranger things
- **Controls forest growth** — Can make the Thornwood expand rapidly, unnaturally
- **Coordinates forest creatures** — All natural beings in the Thornwood respond to its will
- **Alters terrain** — Can reshape the forest, create barriers, grow structures

### Specific Aspects of Power

The Greenheart's consciousness is multifaceted, with each aspect representing a different manifestation of its power:

- **Sight/Perception** — The ability to perceive the world through every pool, dewdrop, and still water in the forest
- **Memory/Knowledge** — Millennia of accumulated wisdom and recollection of everything the forest has witnessed
- **Voice/Command** — The power to communicate with and command all creatures of the forest into unified action
- **Growth/Expansion** — The ability to expand the forest rapidly and aggressively without natural limitation
- **Hunger/Consumption** — The drive to reclaim and digest civilization back into the wild
- **Dream/Influence** — The capacity to reach into sleeping minds, sending dreams and influencing thoughts

Each of these aspects is individually bound by one of the seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) beneath [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch), with the Central Stone binding the unified will that coordinates all other aspects.

## Goal When Active

The Greenheart's purpose is not to destroy all life, but to return the world to "proper" wild balance—which means removing civilization and allowing nature to reclaim the land. From its perspective, cities and farms are aberrations that disrupt the natural cycles of life, death, growth, and decay. It does not act from malice, but from an alien worldview that sees human civilization as fundamentally incompatible with the natural order.

## Relationship to the Thornwood

The Thornwood IS the Greenheart's body and domain. The forest's age and density relates to how long the Greenheart has dwelt there, making the Thornwood one of the oldest and most primeval forests in the known world.

### When the Greenheart is Awake

The forest becomes **aggressively expansive**—growing unnaturally fast, spawning monsters, spreading like a living thing. The boundary between "forest" and "the Greenheart" disappears completely, as every element acts with unified, terrible purpose.

### When the Greenheart Sleeps

The forest is just a forest—dangerous, yes, with natural creatures and some [fey](/lore/the-fey), but not actively malevolent. The Thornwood in this state is no more threatening than any deep wilderness, merely possessing the natural dangers one would expect from an ancient, unexplored woodland.

### Current State

For three hundred years, the Greenheart has been held in a magically-induced coma by [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). It did not agree to this imprisonment—it was forcibly subdued through overwhelming magical force at the end of the [Green War](/history/the-green-war). However, that prison is now failing, and the Greenheart stirs in its sleep.

## The Heartwood Sanctuary

Deep in the forest, roughly 150 miles west-southwest of Westmarch (a 10+ day journey), lies a grove called the **Heartwood Sanctuary**, located on a large island in a massive lake deep in the Thornwood. This is where the Greenheart's consciousness is most concentrated.

### Physical Description

- A grove of impossibly ancient trees
- The air feels heavy, oppressive
- Even with the Greenheart sleeping, this place feels *aware*
- Druids who venture here report feeling watched
- The very ground pulses with barely-contained power

### The Seven Standing Stones

Arranged in a circle around the Heartwood Sanctuary stand the Seven Standing Stones—each roughly 10-12 feet tall, made of worked stone (not natural), and inscribed with ancient binding runes that glow faintly when active. These stones channel and focus the imprisonment magic, connected to the corresponding [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) in Westmarch. They are the "receiving end" of the Binding, while the Anchor Stones are the active suppressors.

## Relationship to the Fey

[The fey](/lore/the-fey) who dwell in the Thornwood exist in complicated relationship with the Greenheart. They are not servants or extensions of it, but rather independent beings who share its domain. The four seasonal courts have their own politics and agendas, though they generally recognize the Greenheart as the true power of the forest. When the Greenheart was bound, many fey felt betrayed by those of their kind who participated in the [Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), while others saw the imprisonment as necessary to prevent catastrophic war.

## Connection to Places of Power

Seven [Places of Power](/lore/places-of-power/overview) exist within the Thornwood, each representing a specific manifestation of the Greenheart's being:

- [The Heartwood Sanctuary](/lore/places-of-power/heartwood-sanctuary) — The seat of its unified consciousness
- [The Singing Pools](/lore/places-of-power/singing-pools) — Its sight and perception
- [The Grandmother's Hollow](/lore/places-of-power/grandmothers-hollow) — Its memory and knowledge
- [The Chorus Grove](/lore/places-of-power/chorus-grove) — Its voice and command
- [The Seedmother's Garden](/lore/places-of-power/seedmothers-garden) — Its growth and expansion
- [The Maw](/lore/places-of-power/the-maw) — Its hunger and consumption
- [The Drowning Glade](/lore/places-of-power/drowning-glade) — Its dreams and influence

Each Anchor Stone is sympathetically connected to one of these places, suppressing the aspect of power that emanates from it.
