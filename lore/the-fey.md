# The Fey

The fey are immortal, magical beings who dwell in the [Thornwood](/locations/thornwood) Forest. They are not servants or extensions of [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart), but rather independent beings who share its domain. Ancient, capricious, and bound by strange codes of behavior, the fey represent a middle ground between the raw primal force of the Greenheart and the ordered civilization of humanity.

## Nature of the Fey

### What They Are

The fey are creatures of magic, emotion, and natural law. Unlike mortals, they do not age or die naturally, though they can be killed. They are deeply connected to the Thornwood, drawing power from the ancient forest, but they possess their own consciousness, desires, and politics.

### Key Characteristics

- **Immortal but not invulnerable** — They can live forever but can be slain
- **Bound by their word** — Fey cannot break promises or oaths they freely make
- **Emotional and passionate** — They feel deeply and act on those feelings
- **Alien morality** — They don't share human concepts of good and evil
- **Connected to nature** — Draw power from the natural world, especially the Thornwood
- **Independent of the Greenheart** — Not servants or extensions, but co-inhabitants of the forest

### Their Magic

Fey magic is different from mortal spellcasting:

- Intuitive rather than learned
- Tied to emotion, deals, and natural law
- Often involves glamours, illusions, and transformations
- Bound by strange rules and limitations
- Powerful but unpredictable

## Relationship to the Greenheart

The fey and the Greenheart exist in a complex relationship:

### Not Servants, But Neighbors

- The fey are independent beings with their own wills and desires
- They recognize the Greenheart as the true power of the forest
- Some revere it as a god-force; others simply respect it as the forest's heart
- They draw power from the same source (the ancient Thornwood) but are not controlled by it

### When the Greenheart Was Active

Before the Binding, when the Greenheart was awake:

- The fey lived in harmony with its will (most of the time)
- The Greenheart did not command them directly, but its influence was pervasive
- The forest was their shared domain, and they generally aligned with its goals
- Some fey courts actively supported the Greenheart during the [Green War](/history/the-green-war)
- Others tried to mediate or remain neutral

### After the Binding

The imprisonment of the Greenheart created a schism among the fey:

**Some fey feel betrayed:**
- Those who participated in [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) are seen as collaborators
- Many believe the Binding is an injustice that must be undone
- These fey work (openly or secretly) to weaken the Binding
- They see humanity as invaders and oppressors

**Others accepted the necessity:**
- They believed the alternative was the complete destruction of the Thornwood
- They saw the Greenheart's defeat as inevitable given the kingdom's power
- They negotiated the best terms they could get
- They continue to honor the Pact, even knowing its true nature

**Most are conflicted:**
- They understand both perspectives
- They resent the deception but fear the consequences of the Greenheart waking
- They maintain an uneasy peace while watching for which way the wind blows

## The Four Seasonal Courts

The fey of the Thornwood are organized into four major courts, each aligned with a season and embodying different aspects of nature's cycle. These courts are political entities as much as magical ones, with complex hierarchies, alliances, and rivalries.

### The Summer Court

**Aspect:** Growth, passion, life at its peak

**Characteristics:**
- Hot-blooded, passionate, quick to both love and rage
- Champions of growth and abundance
- Warriors and protectors of the forest
- Most likely to directly confront threats

**Relationship to the Binding:**
- Generally opposed to it
- See it as a violation of natural order
- Many Summer Court fey are hostile to Westmarch
- Some work actively to weaken the Binding

**Notable Members:**
- Summer nobles who fought in the Green War
- Fierce dryads and warrior satyrs
- Fire-aligned fey

### The Autumn Court

**Aspect:** Harvest, change, transformation

**Characteristics:**
- Pragmatic, focused on balance and exchange
- Masters of deals and bargains
- Accept that all things must change
- Most likely to negotiate with mortals

**Relationship to the Binding:**
- Conflicted but pragmatic
- Understand it as a necessary evil given the circumstances
- Some participated in the Greenwood Pact negotiations
- Generally honor agreements even when they don't like them

**Notable Members:**
- Archdruid Silvanus (the elf who negotiated the Pact) had Autumn Court connections
- Merchant-fey who trade at the borders
- Fey focused on the cycle of growth and decay

### The Winter Court

**Aspect:** Death, rest, endings

**Characteristics:**
- Cold, calculating, patient
- Focused on long-term plans
- Understand that death and sleep are natural
- Most alien to mortal thinking

**Relationship to the Binding:**
- Paradoxically accepting of it
- View the Greenheart's sleep as part of a natural cycle
- Believe "what sleeps may wake when the time is right"
- Neither actively support nor oppose the Binding
- Watch and wait with inhuman patience

**Notable Members:**
- Ancient frost-touched fey

- Beings associated with winter and endings

### The Spring Court

**Aspect:** Rebirth, renewal, hope

**Characteristics:**
- Optimistic, focused on new beginnings
- Believe in redemption and transformation
- Most sympathetic to mortal perspectives
- Seek solutions that preserve both forest and city

**Relationship to the Binding:**
- Deeply troubled by it
- Hate the deception and imprisonment
- But also fear the war that would come from its breaking
- Actively seek a third path—a way to free the Greenheart without catastrophe
- Most likely to ally with those seeking a peaceful solution

**Notable Members:**
- Fey who try to mediate between courts
- Those who work with druids and Rangers
- Beings focused on healing and renewal

## Fey Politics

### Internal Conflicts

The courts are not unified:

- **Summer vs. Winter:** Fire and ice, passion and calculation
- **Spring vs. Autumn:** Hope for change vs. acceptance of reality
- **Within courts:** Individual fey have their own agendas
- **Cross-court alliances:** Some fey ignore court boundaries for personal goals

### Relationship to the Conspiracy

The fey are divided on [Verdanthis's](/characters/npcs/verdanthis) conspiracy to free the Greenheart:

**Some support it:**
- Believe the Greenheart's freedom is worth any cost
- Actively aid the conspiracy
- Provide intelligence, resources, or direct action

**Some oppose it:**
- Fear the war that would result
- Have come to accept the current arrangement
- Value their relationships with mortals or the stability of the Pact

**Most are watching:**
- Waiting to see which side will win
- Keeping options open
- Making no firm commitments until they must

### The Fey and the Rangers

The relationship between fey and the [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green) is complex:

- Rangers take oaths to serve both city and forest
- Some fey respect this dual loyalty
- Others see it as collaboration with oppressors
- Individual Rangers may have fey contacts, allies, or even friends
- But the institutional relationship is strained

## Current State

### As the Binding Weakens

The fey can sense the Binding's deterioration:

- They feel the Greenheart stirring in its sleep
- Some are frightened; others are excited
- Old alliances are being tested
- New factions are forming

### Signs of Fey Activity

- More fey encounters near the border
- Some fey becoming hostile where they were neutral before
- Strange bargains being offered to mortals
- Fey courts sending emissaries to assess the situation
- Increased activity around the Border Stones

### The Coming Crisis

The fey know something is happening:

- They sense the tension building
- They're preparing for multiple possible futures
- Some are choosing sides
- Others are trying to remain neutral
- A few are trying to find a third path

**When the truth comes out—when it's revealed that the Greenheart is waking and a conspiracy is accelerating it—the fey will have to make final choices about where they stand.**

## Types of Fey in the Thornwood

### Common Fey

- **Pixies and sprites:** Small, mischievous, often harmless but annoying
- **Dryads:** Tree-bound, protective of their groves
- **Satyrs:** Revelers and musicians, passionate and free-spirited
- **Nymphs:** Tied to natural features (springs, glades, pools)

### Noble Fey

- **Lords and Ladies of the Courts:** Powerful beings with specific domains
- **Archfey:** Ancient and mighty, approaching god-like power
- **Court champions:** Warriors and heroes of the fey

### Strange Fey

- **Hags:** Not technically court members, but powerful and dangerous
- **Unique beings:** One-of-a-kind fey with specific roles or natures
- **Changed fey:** Those transformed by proximity to the Greenheart's power

## Interacting with the Fey

### Rules of Engagement

Mortals who deal with fey must understand:

- **Never break your word** — Fey remember oaths forever
- **Be precise with language** — They will exploit ambiguity
- **Accept no gift without understanding the cost** — Every fey gift has a price
- **Respect their customs** — Violating fey etiquette can be dangerous
- **Know which court you're dealing with** — Each has different values

### Bargains and Deals

Fey love making deals:

- They are bound by agreements they make
- But they will seek every advantage in the terms
- A poorly worded bargain can have terrible consequences
- Some fey deal fairly; others seek to trap the unwary
- Autumn Court fey are generally the most trustworthy in negotiations

## Connection to Places of Power

Some [Places of Power](/lore/places-of-power/overview) in the Thornwood are particularly associated with fey:

- **[The Grandmother's Hollow](/lore/places-of-power/grandmothers-hollow):** Hags who feed on the Greenheart's memories
- **[The Drowning Glade](/lore/places-of-power/drowning-glade):** A place of dreams where fey have gone mad
- **[The Chorus Grove](/lore/places-of-power/chorus-grove):** Where fey once heard the Greenheart's voice

The fey avoid some Places of Power (too dangerous even for them) while frequenting others.

## Role in the Campaign

### Potential Allies

Some fey may become allies to the party:

- Spring Court fey seeking a peaceful solution
- Individual fey who have their own reasons to help
- Those who have relationships with specific party members
- Fey who fear the chaos of the Greenheart's awakening

### Potential Enemies

Some fey will oppose the party:

- Summer Court fey who want the Greenheart freed at any cost
- Those who have been recruited by Verdanthis
- Fey who simply hate mortals
- Those defending Places of Power the party needs to access

### Sources of Information

The fey know much that mortals don't:

- They remember the Green War firsthand
- They understand the Thornwood's secrets
- They can sense magical disturbances
- They know about Places of Power
- They're aware of conspiracies and plots

**But getting information from fey requires careful negotiation, clever bargaining, and accepting that nothing comes free.**
