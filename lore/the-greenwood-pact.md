# The Greenwood Pact

The Greenwood Pact is the magical treaty signed at the end of the [Green War](/history/the-green-war), three hundred years ago. To most citizens of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch), it is a peace agreement between the kingdom and the [Thornwood](/locations/thornwood) Forest. But this understanding is incomplete—and the true nature of the Pact is far more troubling.

## The Critical Understanding

### The Binding vs. The Pact — Two Different Things

- **[The Binding](/lore/the-binding)** = The prison (magical force, the stones)
- **The Pact** = The lock (magical contract that maintains the prison)
- **The Rangers** = The guards (unknowing jailers)

[The Binding](/lore/the-binding) was brute magical force used to imprison [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart), but brute force degrades over time. The Greenwood Pact was created to reinforce and maintain the Binding through agreed-upon conditions. The Pact is not the imprisonment itself—it is the framework that keeps the prison stable.

## Who Made the Pact

### The Greenheart Was NOT Consulted

The Greenheart was asleep/imprisoned when the Pact was made. It had no voice in these negotiations.

### For the Kingdom

- Duke Garrick Westmarch (the founder)
- Royal diplomats
- The most respected Rangers

### For the Forest

- Archdruid Silvanus (an ancient elf druid who served the Greenheart but recognized the war was lost)
- Representatives of the fey courts (dryads, treants, satyr lords) who lived in the Thornwood
- The First Rangers (those who had always tried to mediate between city and forest)

### The Deception

The forest's representatives believed they were negotiating peace terms. They did not fully understand they were agreeing to maintain a prison. The kingdom's negotiators were not entirely honest about what the Binding was.

**This deception lies at the heart of much of the current crisis.** When the full truth is revealed, many who have honored the Pact in good faith will feel betrayed—and some may decide the agreement is void.

## The Pact's Terms

### Public Terms (What Everyone Knows)

#### The Kingdom Agrees

- Westmarch will not expand beyond its current walls
- No logging beyond the Border Stones
- No hunting in the deep forest beyond the stones
- The forest and its inhabitants will be respected
- The Rangers of the Green will patrol and maintain the boundary

#### The Forest "Agrees"

- The Thornwood will not expand beyond the Border Stones
- Forest creatures will not attack the city
- The area between the city and the Border Stones (the "Green Belt") will remain clear and safe
- Trade roads through the outer forest will be maintained

### The Hidden Truth

The forest did not "agree" to anything—[the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) was unconscious and imprisoned. The representatives who signed on behalf of the forest were either deceived about the full nature of the Binding or were pragmatically accepting the best terms they could get after losing the war.

## How the Pact Actually Works

The Pact was written in **binding magical language** (similar to fey contracts). Both sides took magical oaths. The terms of the agreement literally channel and stabilize the magic of the Binding stones.

### The Mechanics

**When the Pact is honored:**

- Westmarch doesn't expand → Civilized energy stays contained and focused → Binding remains stable
- Forest doesn't attack → Wild energy not aroused or aggressive → Binding remains stable
- Rangers patrol both sides → Bridge between opposing forces → Binding stays balanced

**When the Pact is violated:**

- Violations on either side → Energy imbalance in the binding system → Binding weakens → Greenheart begins to stir

### The Rangers' Critical Role

The Rangers of the Green took dual oaths—to serve both city and forest. This creates a mystical bridge that helps balance the opposing energies of civilization and wilderness. The Rangers don't know they're part of the magical infrastructure keeping the Greenheart imprisoned.

**Their oath literally stabilizes the binding** by creating living conduits between the two opposing forces. This is why [High Ranger Mira Thornweaver](/characters/npcs/mira-thornweaver) will face such a profound crisis when she learns the truth—her entire order has been unknowingly serving as jailers.

## The Border Stones

### What They Are

Ancient stone markers erected by the Fey Courts at the time of the Pact. They mark the extent of the Thornwood's boundary as it existed 300 years ago.

### Physical Description

- Standing stones about 6-8 feet tall
- Carved with fey runes and natural motifs
- Spaced along the forest's edge
- Some visible, some overgrown
- Emanate subtle fey magic

### Function

- Define the legal boundary between civilization and forest
- Logging/hunting beyond them violates the Pact
- The Thornwood agrees not to expand past them
- The Green Belt exists between the city walls and these stones

### Current Status

- Most still stand but some are damaged or moved
- The forest is creeping past some of them
- **This is a sign the Pact is failing**

## Why Violations Matter

### Small Violations Cause Small Weakening

- A few illegal logging trips: Minor degradation
- Occasional border crossing by creatures: Minor imbalance
- Individual Rangers breaking oath: Noticeable but not critical

### Major Violations Cause Significant Weakening

- Systematic logging campaign: Serious damage
- Westmarch attempting expansion: Major crisis
- Multiple Rangers abandoning posts: Critical weakening
- Damaging an [Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) directly: Catastrophic

### Repeated Violations Compound Over Time

- Generations of small violations have added up
- Like small cracks in a dam eventually causing collapse
- The Binding has been slowly weakening for decades

**Examples of Accumulated Violations:**

- Noble houses secretly logging protected groves
- Merchants pressuring for road expansions
- Hunters venturing beyond the Border Stones
- Fey creatures retaliating against perceived encroachment
- Each violation weakens the Binding slightly
- Together they've created significant cumulative damage

## Current State of the Pact

### Three Concurrent Causes of Failure

1. **Natural Erosion (300 years of decay):** The magical framework has degraded over time
2. **Accumulated Violations (Death by a thousand cuts):** Generations of small Pact violations have added up
3. **Deliberate Sabotage (The conspiracy):** [Verdanthis](/characters/npcs/verdanthis) and her agents are actively engineering major violations

**The Perfect Storm:** All three causes happening simultaneously means the Pact (and therefore the Binding) is failing faster than it ever has.

### Signs the Pact Is Failing

- Forest creatures becoming more aggressive
- The Thornwood creeping past some Border Stones
- Rangers losing their connection to the forest
- Fey becoming hostile
- The Green Belt shrinking
- Nightmares about the forest spreading through the city
- Strange manifestations near the border

## The Moral Crisis

### For Those Who Learn the Truth

When people discover that the Pact is not a peace treaty but a prison maintenance agreement, they will face difficult questions:

**For the Rangers:**
- We swore to serve both city and forest, but we've been jailers all along
- Our sacred duty has been built on a lie
- Do we continue to honor an oath made under false pretenses?

**For Druids and Fey:**
- Our ancestors were deceived about what they were agreeing to
- We've been helping maintain an unjust imprisonment
- Is the Greenheart's freedom worth the catastrophic war that would follow?

**For the Kingdom:**
- We've maintained peace for 300 years through deception and force
- Is imprisoning a primordial being morally justifiable?
- What are our obligations to a prisoner we've held for three centuries?

### The Impossible Choice

Even those who believe the Binding is unjust must grapple with what would happen if it fails:

- The Greenheart waking means war
- Westmarch would fall
- Thousands would die
- Civilization would be pushed back hundreds of miles

**Is maintaining an unjust prison better than allowing a catastrophic war?** This question has no easy answer, and different people will answer it differently.

## Who Knows the Truth

### [Tier 1: Common Knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers)
Everyone knows there was a Greenwood Pact that ended the Green War and maintains peace.

### [Tier 2: Educated Knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers)
Nobles and scholars understand the Pact has actual magical weight and violations have consequences.

### [Tier 3: Specialist Knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers)
Senior Rangers, druids, and dedicated scholars understand the Pact maintains some kind of binding on the Greenheart.

### [Tier 4: Inner Circle Knowledge](/lore/knowledge-tiers)
Only 5-10 people know the full truth: that the Pact is specifically designed to maintain the Binding, that the forest's representatives were partially deceived, and that the Rangers are unwitting jailers.

### [Tier 5: The Emerging Crisis](/lore/knowledge-tiers)
Almost no one knows the Pact is actively failing and someone is deliberately sabotaging it—until the party discovers this truth.

## Breaking the Pact

### What Happens If the Pact Is Deliberately Broken

If either side formally renounces the Pact:

- The magical framework collapses
- The Binding loses a major source of stability
- The Greenheart begins to wake immediately
- Rapid progression to [Stage 2 or Stage 3 awakening](/lore/the-binding#stages-of-binding-failure)

### What Happens If the Pact Cannot Be Maintained

If circumstances make it impossible to honor the terms (for example, if Westmarch must expand to survive, or if the forest cannot be controlled):

- The same gradual weakening that has been happening accelerates
- The Binding degrades faster
- Both sides may feel justified in further violations
- A death spiral toward complete failure

### Can the Pact Be Renegotiated?

This is one of the central questions the party may need to answer:

- Can you renegotiate a contract when one party (the Greenheart) is still unconscious?
- Would awakening the Greenheart enough to negotiate mean risking it breaking free?
- Would the forest's representatives agree to maintain a prison they now understand was built on deception?
- Could new terms be written that are both honest and stable?
