# The Five Tiers of Knowledge

Not everyone in [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch) knows the same things about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding), [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart), and [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact). Knowledge is distributed in layers, with each tier understanding more than the last—but even the highest tiers don't know everything.

This reference system is used throughout NPC pages to indicate what each character knows and believes. Understanding these tiers is crucial for roleplaying NPCs correctly and for understanding the dramatic impact of revelations.

---

## Tier 1: Common Knowledge (Everyone Knows This)

What every citizen of Westmarch and the surrounding kingdom understands:

### What They Know

- **There was a Green War 300 years ago**—a devastating conflict between the kingdom and "the forest"
- **The Greenwood Pact ended it**—a treaty that brought peace
- **Honor the Pact or bad things happen**—break the treaty and the forest becomes dangerous
- **Don't anger the forest**—general wisdom about respecting the Thornwood
- **Westmarch guards the border**—the city has a special duty to maintain peace
- **The Rangers serve both sides**—they patrol and keep the peace

### The Problem

This has become background cultural knowledge, like proverbs or old wives' tales. People know it the way modern people "know" old superstitions—they can recite it, but they don't really believe it matters anymore.

**For most citizens, the Pact is ancient history that has little relevance to daily life.**

### Who Falls Into This Tier

- Common citizens of Westmarch
- Merchants, craftspeople, laborers
- Most soldiers and city guards
- Farmers in the surrounding region
- Travelers and traders passing through
- Children learning history in school

### Example NPCs at This Tier

- Market vendors
- Tavern keepers
- Common soldiers
- Most residents of [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens)
- Ordinary merchants in [Duke's Bridge](/locations/westmarch/dukes-bridge)

---

## Tier 2: Educated Knowledge (Nobles, Scholars, Merchants)

What people with education, resources, or positions of authority understand:

### What They Know

- **The war was against "the spirit of the forest"**—not just monsters, but something more
- **There are sacred stones in the forest**—seven Standing Stones that shouldn't be disturbed
- **Westmarch has a special magical role**—the city isn't just militarily important
- **The Pact has actual magical weight**—it's not just a political treaty
- **Violations have real consequences**—breaking terms causes supernatural backlash
- **The Rangers' oaths are mystically binding**—their dual service is more than symbolic

### The Problem

Even educated people tend to view this as historical curiosity or academic theory. They understand intellectually that the Pact matters, but many don't fully grasp the practical implications.

**They know the facts but often don't believe in the urgency.**

### Who Falls Into This Tier

- Minor nobility
- Educated merchants and guild masters
- Junior priests and acolytes
- Academy instructors
- Well-read citizens
- Junior officers in the military
- Some senior Rangers (who haven't been told more)

### Example NPCs at This Tier

- Lesser noble house heads
- Successful merchant family members
- Temple priests (not high-ranking)
- Junior scholars at the Archive
- Educated advisors
- Some members of [the Council](/factions/westmarch-council)

---

## Tier 3: Specialist Knowledge (Senior Rangers, Druids, Dedicated Scholars)

What people who work closely with the forest or study it intensively understand:

### What They Know

- **The Greenheart is (or was) a real entity**—an actual conscious being, not a metaphor
- **It was defeated/bound at the end of the war**—not killed, but imprisoned somehow
- **The Pact maintains the binding**—the treaty isn't just peace terms; it's a magical lock
- **The Seven Stones are part of a binding ritual**—they have a specific magical function
- **Westmarch's location is not coincidental**—the city was built exactly where it is for magical reasons
- **The Rangers are part of the binding system**—their service literally helps maintain the magic

### The Problem

Even most people at this tier don't fully understand or believe what they know. They have pieces of the truth but not the complete picture. Many treat this knowledge as theory rather than operational reality.

**They understand the mechanism but may not grasp the danger.**

### Who Falls Into This Tier

- Senior Rangers (not High Ranger level)
- Circle druids who study the Thornwood
- Dedicated scholars who've researched the Green War
- Some senior priests of nature deities
- Historians specializing in this period
- Fey who remember the war but weren't involved in leadership
- Ancient elves who were alive during the Green War but not in positions of power

### Example NPCs at This Tier

- Senior Greenwatch Rangers
- [Circle of the Green](/factions/circle-of-the-green) druids
- Archivists who've studied the Binding extensively
- Some very old elves
- Certain fey who've lived in the Thornwood for centuries
- Priests of Silvanus or other nature gods who've made this their study

---

## Tier 4: Inner Circle Knowledge (5-10 People Know This)

What only a handful of people alive understand—the complete operational truth:

### Who Knows

- [Duke Aldric Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch) (current ruler, inherited the knowledge)
- [High Ranger Mira Thornweaver](/characters/npcs/mira-thornweaver) (told when she took the position)
- Perhaps 1-2 other senior Westmarch family members
- Possibly Archdruid Theron (ancient elf) or their chosen successor
- 2-3 "Pact Wardens"—secret keepers who maintain the knowledge
- A few very old elves who were present at the founding

### What They Know

- **The exact mechanics of the Binding**—how the Seven Stones and Seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) work together
- **The location of all Seven Anchor Stones**—deep in Westmarch's foundations
- **That Westmarch itself IS part of the prison**—the city channels civilized energy to suppress the Greenheart
- **How to maintain the Binding**—what rituals or reinforcement the Anchor Stones need
- **The true terms of the Pact**—why specific violations weaken the Binding
- **That the Greenheart never agreed**—it was forcibly imprisoned, not negotiated with
- **What will happen if it wakes**—the catastrophic consequences of failure

### Why So Few

- **Original decision:** The founders decided this was too dangerous to be widely known
- **Security concerns:** Can't sabotage what you don't know exists
- **Moral burden:** Few people could live with the knowledge they're maintaining a prison
- **Natural attrition:** 300 years of deaths, with each generation choosing fewer successors
- **Deliberate secrecy:** Each keeper tells very few others, and only when necessary
- **Magical oaths:** Those who know are bound by powerful oaths not to reveal the truth

### The Burden of Knowledge

People at this tier carry an enormous weight:

- They know the city depends on a lie
- They understand the moral implications of the Binding
- They must decide who else can be trusted with this knowledge
- They live with the constant fear of what happens if the truth comes out
- They must maintain the Binding while keeping it secret

### Example NPCs at This Tier

- [Duke Aldric Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch) — Knows everything, checks the Central Stone obsessively
- [High Ranger Mira Thornweaver](/characters/npcs/mira-thornweaver) — Knows the Rangers are part of the binding system
- Possibly [Chief Archivist Elara](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) — May be approaching this level through research
- Ancient elves who were advisors during the war
- A hidden "Keeper of the Binding" if one exists

---

## Tier 5: The Emerging Crisis (Almost No One Knows This)

What only 2-3 people might suspect, and what the party will discover:

### What Almost No One Knows

- **The Binding is actively failing**—not just ancient and worn, but currently degrading
- **Someone is deliberately sabotaging it**—there's a conspiracy to free the Greenheart
- **The Greenheart is beginning to wake**—the stirring has already begun
- **Time is running out**—months or years, not centuries
- **What specifically needs to be done**—the exact steps to prevent catastrophe

### Who Might Know Pieces

- **[Duke Aldric](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch)** might suspect the Binding is weakening but not know about sabotage
- **[High Ranger Mira](/characters/npcs/mira-thornweaver)** might sense something wrong but not understand it's systemic failure
- **[Verdanthis](/characters/npcs/verdanthis)** knows everything—she's orchestrating it
- Some of her agents know parts of the plan

### The Party's Role

**The party will be the ones who piece together the full picture.**

They will discover:
- The damaged [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone)
- Evidence of sabotage
- [Lord Brennan's](/characters/npcs/lord-brennan-westmarch) betrayal
- The conspiracy to free the Greenheart
- What's needed to repair the Binding
- The moral complexity of the entire situation

### The Weight of This Knowledge

Once the party knows Tier 5 information, they will understand:

- The scope of the threat
- The time pressure they're under
- Who can and cannot be trusted
- The moral ambiguity of the situation
- That there may be no "right" answer, only difficult choices

## Using the Tiers in Play

### For the DM

When creating or playing NPCs:

1. **Determine their tier** based on their position and background
2. **Roleplay only what they know** — Don't let them act on knowledge they don't have
3. **Show the limits of their understanding** — Even Tier 3 characters don't know everything
4. **Create dramatic reveals** — Moving someone from one tier to another is a major moment

### For Players

Understanding tiers helps you:

- Know who to trust with what information
- Understand why NPCs react the way they do
- Anticipate the consequences of revealing secrets
- Decide when to share knowledge and when to withhold it

### Tier Transitions Are Dramatic Moments

When a character moves from one tier to another, it should be significant:

- **Tier 1 → Tier 2:** "Wait, this isn't just old history?"
- **Tier 2 → Tier 3:** "The Greenheart is REAL?"
- **Tier 3 → Tier 4:** "We've been maintaining a PRISON?"
- **Tier 4 → Tier 5:** "And it's FAILING RIGHT NOW?"

Each transition fundamentally changes how a character views the world.

- **Tier 2:** Heads of lesser noble houses
- **Tier 3:** Senior advisors to great houses
