# The Northbank Stone

The Northbank Stone is one of the seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) that comprise [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). It binds [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) ability to reach into sleeping minds—to send dreams, influence thoughts, and touch the consciousness of mortals. This stone has been **deliberately damaged by Lord Brennan**, who owns the estate beneath which it sits. His careful, subtle sabotage represents a major conspiracy reaching the highest levels of Westmarch's nobility.

## Aspect Bound

**Dream / Influence**

The Northbank Stone suppresses the Greenheart's ability to reach into sleeping minds—to send dreams, influence thoughts, and touch the consciousness of mortals. When the Greenheart was active, it could speak to mortals in their sleep, showing them visions, planting ideas, calling them to the forest. The Northbank Stone prevents this insidious influence.

## Location

Beneath Lord Brennan's mansion in the center of Northbank, one of Westmarch's wealthiest districts.

## Access

Access to the Northbank Stone is completely controlled by Lord Brennan:

- In Lord Brennan's private estate
- Multiple basement levels
- Beyond the wine cellar
- Hidden door requires knowing where to look
- Heavily guarded property with regular patrols
- Only Brennan and possibly a few trusted agents know it exists

## The Chamber

The chamber has been deliberately concealed by its owner:

- Small room deliberately concealed
- Brennan has covered it with furniture and cloth
- The stone is hidden but accessible
- He visits regularly to continue his work of sabotage
- Chamber likely locked or trapped against intrusion

## Current Condition

**DELIBERATELY DAMAGED (Ongoing Sabotage)**

Lord Brennan has been sabotaging this stone for months:

- **Not obvious damage** — He's careful and subtle
- **Runes scratched and chipped gradually** over time
- **Some magical suppression applied** to weaken the binding
- **Significantly weakened but not catastrophically broken** yet
- **Clever enough that casual inspection wouldn't notice** the damage
- Ongoing project rather than single act of destruction

Brennan's approach is more sophisticated than the crude sabotage of the [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone)—he's degrading it slowly to avoid immediate detection.

## Who Knows

Knowledge of the Northbank Stone is extremely limited and dangerous:

- **Lord Brennan** — Owns the property, knows exactly what it is, actively sabotaging it
- **Verdanthis** — Instructing him on how to damage it
- **Possibly one or two of Brennan's most trusted agents** — Might know pieces of the truth
- **No one else**

This represents a complete betrayal of trust—a member of the ducal family actively working to free the Greenheart.

## If Damaged (Current Effects)

The Northbank Stone's damage is already causing observable effects:

- Nightmares spread through nearby districts
- People dream of the forest calling to them
- Some sleepwalk toward the walls
- The Greenheart's dreaming mind begins to touch mortals
- Not full awareness, but fragments of its sleeping thoughts
- Those with sensitivity to nature are most affected:
  - Druids experience vivid, disturbing dreams
  - Fey become agitated
  - Those like Quill feel the pull strongly
- Increasing reports of disturbed sleep in western Westmarch
- Some people report hearing whispers in their dreams

## Place of Power: The Drowning Glade

The Northbank Stone is sympathetically connected to **[The Drowning Glade](/lore/places-of-power/the-drowning-glade)** in the Thornwood.

The Drowning Glade is a beautiful, peaceful clearing with a still pool at its center. But those who sleep here never wake, trapped in endless dreams where the Greenheart's sleeping mind bleeds into their own. The boundary between sleep and death blurs in this place. Creatures born from nightmares dwell here, or fey driven mad by proximity to the Greenheart's dreaming.

**To repair the Northbank Stone, Source Material from the Drowning Glade would be required.**

## Significance

The Northbank Stone's sabotage reveals several critical facts:

- **MAJOR CONSPIRACY REVELATION** — This is not random sabotage
- **Proves a member of the ducal family is a traitor** — Lord Brennan is Duke Aldric's cousin
- **Shows the conspiracy reaches the highest levels** — They have wealth, position, and access
- **Difficult to prove** — He's powerful and well-protected
- **Political explosion if revealed** — Would tear Westmarch's nobility apart
- **Demonstrates sophisticated understanding** — Brennan knows how to damage the stone without causing immediate catastrophe

## Lord Brennan's Betrayal

Lord Brennan is a complex traitor:

### His Motivation
- Ideologically aligned with Verdanthis
- Believes the Binding is morally wrong
- Convinced that freeing the Greenheart is the right thing to do
- Doesn't fully understand (or care about) the catastrophic consequences

### His Advantages
- Owns the property where the stone sits
- Wealthy enough to deflect suspicion
- Connected enough to have political protection
- Smart enough to work slowly and carefully
- Ruthless enough to continue despite the nightmares he's causing

### His Vulnerability
- If caught, the evidence is literally in his basement
- His regular visits to the chamber could be observed
- The increasing nightmares in western districts point toward Northbank
- He might have kept records or correspondence with Verdanthis

## Strategic Implications

The Northbank Stone presents unique challenges:

**Complications:**
- Owner is actively hostile and sabotaging it
- Any attempt to access it means confronting a powerful noble
- Political consequences of accusing Brennan without proof
- Even with proof, arresting him will be explosive
- His guards protect the approach routes
- He's been warned by Verdanthis to watch for investigators

**Opportunities:**
- His ongoing sabotage means he visits regularly (could be caught)
- The nightmares provide evidence of the stone's damage
- His connection to Verdanthis might be provable
- Stopping him stops at least one source of sabotage
- His arrest would disrupt the conspiracy significantly

## The Nightmare Evidence

The increasing nightmares in western Westmarch provide a trail of evidence:

- Concentrated in districts closest to Northbank
- Reports began several months ago (when Brennan's sabotage started)
- Intensity has increased as the damage worsened
- Those most sensitive to nature are most affected
- The dreams consistently feature:
  - The forest calling
  - Ancient trees
  - Feeling watched by something vast
  - Compulsion to walk toward the Thornwood
  - Sense of awakening

Tracking these reports could lead investigators to suspect Northbank, and from there to Brennan's estate.

## Relationship to the Greenheart

Dreams are the bridge between consciousness and unconsciousness, between waking and sleeping, between self and other. The Greenheart's ability to reach into dreams is perhaps its most insidious power—it allows the primordial spirit to touch mortal minds directly, to plant ideas that feel like your own thoughts, to call you with visions that seem like revelation.

The Northbank Stone prevents this intimate violation. It keeps the Greenheart isolated in its own sleeping mind, unable to reach out, unable to influence, unable to call for help or recruit agents from the mortal world.

With the stone damaged, the Greenheart's dreaming mind begins to bleed out into the world. It's not conscious—not yet—but its dreams are so powerful that they leak into nearby mortals' sleep. Those dreams carry fragments of the Greenheart's nature: ancient, vast, patient, and utterly incompatible with civilized life.

If this stone were to fail completely, every mortal within miles would dream the Greenheart's dreams. Some would wake. Some would not. And those who did wake would no longer be entirely themselves—they would carry fragments of the forest's consciousness within them, hearing its voice, feeling its call, unable to resist its pull.

## Confronting Brennan

Eventually, the truth about Lord Brennan must be confronted:

### Evidence Needed
- Proof he's accessing the chamber regularly
- Connection to Verdanthis or the conspiracy
- Testimony from those suffering nightmares
- Magical analysis showing the damage is recent and deliberate
- Possibly caught in the act

### Political Consequences
- Duke Aldric will be devastated (Brennan is family)
- Other noble families will take sides
- Some might defend Brennan out of class loyalty
- Others might distance themselves
- The revelation will shake confidence in Westmarch's leadership

### Stopping the Sabotage
- Even if Brennan can't be arrested immediately, stopping his access to the stone is critical
- The chamber might need to be secured by force
- Guards will need to be posted
- Repairs can only begin once he's neutralized
