# The Seven Anchor Stones

The Seven Anchor Stones are ancient magical artifacts embedded deep in Westmarch's foundations, forming the keystone of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) that imprisons [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart). Each stone is roughly 3-4 feet in diameter, carved from worked stone inscribed with powerful binding runes. Together with the Seven Standing Stones in the Heartwood Sanctuary, they create a magical prison that has held for three centuries.

That prison is now failing.

## The Binding System

The Anchor Stones work in concert with the Seven Standing Stones erected in the Heartwood Sanctuary deep in the Thornwood. The system channels energy in a specific pattern:

**The Energy Flow:**
The Thornwood's own vital energy → Channeled through Westmarch (filtered through civilization's ordered essence) → Flows through the Seven Anchor Stones (the star pattern concentrates it) → Focused by the Central Stone → Transmitted to the Seven Standing Stones → Keeps the Greenheart in forced dormancy

### Key Principles

- **The Binding uses the forest's vitality against itself**, filtered through the essence of civilization (order, community, constructed spaces) to suppress the Greenheart's wild consciousness
- **Each Anchor Stone binds a specific aspect** of the Greenheart's power by targeting the place in the Thornwood where that aspect manifests most strongly
- **The stones are sympathetically connected** to Places of Power in the Thornwood
- **Repair requires Source Material** from the corresponding Place of Power for each stone

## Physical Description

- Roughly 3-4 feet in diameter
- Worked stone with binding runes inscribed on the surface
- Embedded deep in foundations/bedrock throughout Westmarch
- Most are in locations that have been built over
- Invisible unless you know where to look
- Emit faint magical aura (detectable with *Detect Magic*)
- Runes glow faintly when active

## Arrangement

The seven stones are arranged in a **star pattern** across Westmarch, with the Central Stone beneath the Citadel serving as the focal point. This geometric arrangement concentrates the civilizing energy flowing through the city.

## Standing Stones vs. Anchor Stones

It's critical to understand the distinction between these two sets of stones:

### The Seven Standing Stones
- **Location:** Heartwood Sanctuary in the Thornwood (150 miles west-southwest of Westmarch)
- **Function:** The "receiving end" of the binding magic
- **Physical Form:** 10-12 feet tall, arranged in a circle around the ancient grove
- **Purpose:** Channel and focus the imprisonment magic directly onto the Greenheart's concentrated consciousness

### The Seven Anchor Stones
- **Location:** Embedded beneath Westmarch in a star pattern
- **Function:** The active suppressors that generate the binding magic
- **Physical Form:** 3-4 feet across, hidden in foundations and basements
- **Purpose:** Draw power from civilization itself and channel it toward the Standing Stones

## What Happens When Stones Fail

The Binding's failure progresses according to how many stones are damaged:

### One Stone Damaged (Current State)
- System weakened but functional
- Local effects near damaged stone (fog in the Warrens)
- The Greenheart begins to stir
- Other stones strain to compensate

### Two Stones Fail
- System critically weakened
- Multiple manifestations across city
- The Greenheart achieving limited consciousness
- Weeks until Stage 2 awakening

### Three or More Stones Fail
- System collapsing
- Cannot maintain binding
- Days until full awakening
- Emergency measures needed

### Central Stone Fails
- **Instant system collapse**
- All other stones become inert
- The Greenheart wakes immediately
- Catastrophe

   - Location: Greenwatch Ranger headquarters
   - Place of Power: [The Chorus Grove](/lore/places-of-power/the-chorus-grove)
   - Status: Dimming

5. **[South Market Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/south-market-stone)** — Growth/Expansion

## Repairing Anchor Stones

Repairing a damaged Anchor Stone requires three components:

### 1. Physical Repair
- The stone must be physically mended
- Runes must be re-engraved
- Requires Source Stone material from the corresponding Place of Power
- Skilled craftsmen can perform this work

### 2. Power Infusion
- Once physically restored, magical power must be infused
- The power must be infused **all at once**—in a single round
- This is not a drawn-out ritual; it's a single massive surge

### 3. The Power Requirement
- Power is measured in spell slot equivalents
- A 9th-level slot = 9 points of power
- A 1st-level slot = 1 point of power
- Damaged stones require approximately 40-100 points
- Multiple casters can contribute simultaneously
- Each caster can sacrifice one slot per round

### The Problem

Westmarch doesn't have enough high-level casters to generate 40-100 points of power in a single round. They would need to summon mages from across the kingdom—which takes time they may not have.

### The Solution: The Tess-Kydra

An ancient ritual vessel created during the Green War specifically for powering large-scale magical workings. A caster can invest one spell slot per day into the Tess-Kydra, and the device stores this power indefinitely. The stored power can be released all at once.

**Current Status:** Stolen by Verdanthis's kobolds during the Green War. Currently held at Harrow Keep in the Thornwood, guarded by the Poison Scale kobold tribe.
