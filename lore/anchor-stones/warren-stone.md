# The Warren Stone

The Warren Stone is one of the seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) that comprise [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). It binds [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) ability to perceive the world—to see, sense, and observe through the forest. This stone is **critically damaged** due to deliberate sabotage, and is the primary source of the unnatural fog that has plagued [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) for months.

## Aspect Bound

**Sight / Perception**

The Warren Stone suppresses the Greenheart's ability to perceive the world around it—to see, sense, and observe through the forest. When active, the Greenheart sees through every pool, every dewdrop, every still water in the Thornwood. The Warren Stone blinds the Greenheart to the world beyond its sleeping mind.

## Location

Deep in the Undercroft beneath [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens), isolated and forgotten in the city's oldest sewer tunnels.

## Access

Reaching the Warren Stone is treacherous:

- Must navigate the dangerous Undercroft (sewer system)
- Multiple levels of sewer tunnels
- Old maintenance tunnels with collapsed entrance (must be cleared)
- Descend another level through debris
- The chamber is isolated, forgotten, and partially flooded

The difficulty of access is one reason this stone was vulnerable to sabotage—no one has checked on it in decades, possibly centuries.

## The Chamber

The chamber housing the Warren Stone has been severely neglected:

- Small room with walls weeping water
- Ankle-deep standing water throughout
- The Anchor Stone sits partially submerged
- Poor drainage causes constant dampness
- Structurally unsound (cracks visible in walls)
- Stale air with the smell of mold and decay

## Current Condition

**CRITICALLY DAMAGED (Deliberate Sabotage)**

The Warren Stone shows clear signs of intentional destruction:

- **Large crack across one side of the stone**
- Several binding runes completely obliterated
- Glow is dim, flickering erratically
- Pieces of stone chipped away (lying in the water)
- **Tool marks visible—deliberate sabotage**
- The damage happened approximately 3 months ago
- **Currently warded by the temples (temporary containment)**

### What Happened

Evidence and investigation reveal the following timeline:

1. Conspirators accessed this chamber three months ago
2. They deliberately damaged the stone with tools
3. Couldn't destroy it entirely (too magically reinforced)
4. The damage weakened the Binding enough to cause the fog
5. Water damage and neglect made the deterioration worse over time
6. This is the primary source of the current crisis

## If Damaged (Current Effects)

With the Warren Stone damaged, sensory chaos bleeds into the area near the stone:

- **Unnatural fog** throughout the Warrens that disorients and confuses
- Disorientation and loss of direction
- Whispers at the edge of hearing
- Those affected may experience visions or feel watched by something vast
- The Greenheart begins to perceive dimly—not full awareness, but flickering, confused impressions of the world
- Increased supernatural occurrences in the Warrens

## Who Knows

Knowledge of the Warren Stone's existence and condition is extremely limited:

- **Temple leadership** — Knows the stone exists and is damaged; has placed temporary wards
- **The conspiracy** — Those who sabotaged it know exactly where it is
- **No one else** currently knows this stone exists or what it does

Before the recent crisis, no one had checked on this stone in decades.

## Place of Power: The Singing Pools

The Warren Stone is sympathetically connected to **[The Singing Pools](/lore/places-of-power/the-singing-pools)** in the Thornwood.

The Singing Pools are the Greenheart's sensorium—its eyes and ears. The waters show visions because they are connected to the Greenheart's perception. When active, the Greenheart sees through every pool, every dewdrop, every still water in the Thornwood. The Warren Stone suppresses this sight by targeting the source of the Greenheart's perceptive power.

**To repair the Warren Stone, Source Stone material from the Singing Pools is required.**

## Significance

The Warren Stone is significant for several reasons:

- **KEY DISCOVERY FOR THE PARTY** — Proves deliberate sabotage
- **Shows this is a conspiracy** — Not natural occurrence or accident
- **First confirmed breach** — Demonstrates the Binding can be attacked
- **Can potentially be repaired** — With right materials and magic
- **Reveals the conspiracy's methods** — They know where the stones are and how to damage them

## Repair Requirements

Repairing the Warren Stone requires:

### 1. Physical Repair
- Source Stone material from [The Singing Pools](/lore/places-of-power/the-singing-pools) *(Retrieved)*
- Skilled craftsmen to mend the stone
- Re-engraving the obliterated binding runes

### 2. Power Infusion
- Requires 40-100 points of power (spell slot equivalents)
- Must be infused all at once in a single round
- The Tess-Kydra ritual vessel is needed to accumulate sufficient power *(Not yet retrieved)*

### 3. Current Status
- Source Stone has been retrieved from the Singing Pools
- The Tess-Kydra is held at Harrow Keep in the Thornwood, guarded by the Poison Scale kobold tribe
- Physical repairs can begin once both components are secured
- Temple wards are holding but are temporary measures only

## Strategic Implications

The damage to the Warren Stone reveals several critical facts:

1. **The conspiracy knows about the Anchor Stones** — They have knowledge that should be restricted to only a handful of people
2. **They can access even hidden locations** — The Undercroft didn't stop them
3. **They are willing to risk awakening the Greenheart** — This is not mere political maneuvering
4. **Multiple stones may be targeted** — If they damaged this one, others are at risk
5. **Time is critical** — The longer the stone remains damaged, the more the Greenheart stirs

## Relationship to the Greenheart

When the Warren Stone functions properly, it creates a form of magical blindness. The Greenheart cannot perceive the world outside its dreaming mind—it exists in a state of sensory deprivation that reinforces its forced dormancy.

With the stone damaged, the Greenheart's perception begins to return. It doesn't see clearly—not yet—but it feels impressions, senses movement, perceives dimly through the fog. This partial awakening of its perceptive faculty is the first step toward full consciousness.

If the stone fails completely, the Greenheart would regain full sight through every drop of water, every pool, every living thing in the Thornwood. Its gaze would turn immediately toward Westmarch, and it would see exactly what has imprisoned it.
