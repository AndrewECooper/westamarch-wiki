# The South Market Stone

The South Market Stone is one of the seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) that comprise [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). It binds [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) power of growth—its ability to expand the forest rapidly and aggressively, to reproduce and spread without natural limitation. This stone is currently stable but completely neglected, with no living person aware of its existence.

## Aspect Bound

**Growth / Expansion**

The South Market Stone suppresses the Greenheart's power of growth—its ability to expand the forest rapidly and aggressively, to reproduce and spread without natural limitation. When the Greenheart was active, the Thornwood could grow miles per day, overwhelming cleared land and reclaiming civilization in weeks. The South Market Stone prevents this explosive expansion.

## Location

Beneath an old warehouse in the South Market area, in the southern part of the Greenmark.

## Access

The South Market Stone can be accessed through multiple routes:

- Below an old warehouse used for market storage
- Accessed through a forgotten maintenance tunnel
- From the Undercroft (sewer system)
- Or through the warehouse's old cellar (if you know where to look)

The multiple access points make this stone potentially vulnerable to discovery by anyone exploring the Undercroft or investigating old city infrastructure.

## The Chamber

The chamber is in a state of significant neglect:

- Neglected, dusty, forgotten
- Stone sits in a small room surrounded by old structural supports
- Some debris and old crates stacked nearby
- The supports are actually part of the binding architecture
- Rats and minor vermin present
- Accumulated dust and grime obscure some features

## Current Condition

**Stable but Neglected**

Despite decades of neglect, the South Market Stone remains functional:

- No one has checked this in decades
- Runes dirty but intact
- Glow faint but steady
- Accumulated grime obscures some markings
- The stone's magical resilience has prevented degradation
- Structural integrity maintained despite the environment

## Who Knows

**No one currently knows this stone exists.**

This represents the most complete loss of knowledge about any Anchor Stone:

- Old records in the Deep Vaults mention it
- The Blackstone family might have ancient records (they owned this property 200 years ago)
- But no living person is aware of its location or function

This makes the South Market Stone both vulnerable and potentially useful—it could be studied safely precisely because no one is watching.

## If Damaged (Potential Effects)

If the South Market Stone were to be damaged or fail, the effects would be immediately visible in the Green Belt:

- The Green Belt begins to fail
- Plants grow unnaturally fast, reclaiming cleared land overnight
- Roots crack cobblestones throughout southern Westmarch
- Vines climb walls in the Greenmark districts
- Seeds sprout in impossible places—between stones, in dead soil, even indoors
- The forest begins to expand toward the city, slowly at first
- Growth becomes increasingly aggressive and rapid
- Cleared land becomes overgrown within days

## Place of Power: The Seedmother's Garden

The South Market Stone is sympathetically connected to **[The Seedmother's Garden](/lore/places-of-power/the-seedmothers-garden)** in the Thornwood.

The Seedmother's Garden is a place of obscene fecundity where plants grow, die, and regrow in accelerated cycles. Fungal blooms the size of houses. Flowers that bloom and rot in minutes. At its heart, something endlessly births new life—the source of blights and awakened plants when the Greenheart stirs. This is growth without restraint, life as an overwhelming force.

**To repair the South Market Stone (if damaged), Source Material from the Seedmother's Garden would be required.**

## Significance

The South Market Stone is significant for several reasons:

- **Vulnerable to discovery** by anyone exploring the Undercroft
- **Could be easily damaged** if conspirators find it
- **Protecting this requires the party to discover it first** — They must learn of its existence
- **Good location for the party to study an Anchor Stone safely** — No oversight means no interference
- **Represents the complete loss of institutional knowledge** — Even the carefully maintained secrecy has failed

## Strategic Implications

The South Market Stone presents unique challenges and opportunities:

**Advantages:**
- No oversight means no political complications
- Could be studied without raising alarm
- Multiple access routes provide options
- Current stability means no immediate crisis

**Vulnerabilities:**
- No one watching means no one protecting
- Multiple access routes make it easier to attack
- Complete lack of knowledge means no maintenance
- Conspirators could damage it undetected
- Location in a commercial area means civilian casualties if it fails

## The Lost Knowledge Problem

The South Market Stone exemplifies a larger problem with the Binding:

Three hundred years ago, multiple people knew the locations of all seven Anchor Stones. Each generation, fewer people were told. The knowledge became more restricted, more secret. Eventually, some stones were simply forgotten.

This wasn't malicious—it was the result of:
- Deaths without succession
- Decisions to reduce the number of people who knew
- Lost records
- Changing ownership of properties
- Natural erosion of institutional memory

Now the South Market Stone sits, forgotten, with no one to protect it or maintain it. It continues to function through magical resilience alone.

## Relationship to the Greenheart

Growth is one of the Greenheart's most fundamental powers. In its natural state, the Thornwood would expand constantly, slowly but inevitably reclaiming any cleared land. When the Greenheart is active, this expansion becomes explosive—supernatural in speed and aggression.

The South Market Stone doesn't prevent growth entirely—the Thornwood still exists, still thrives. But it prevents the aggressive, purposeful expansion that characterizes the Greenheart's active state. It's the difference between a forest existing and a forest conquering.

If this stone were to fail, the Green Belt would disappear within days. The carefully maintained border between civilization and wilderness would vanish as the forest surged forward with supernatural vitality. Westmarch would find itself in a race to build walls faster than the forest can tear them down.

## The Blackstone Connection

The Blackstone family owned the property where the South Market Stone is located approximately 200 years ago. This raises several questions:

- Did they know about the stone?
- Do they have records in their family archives?
- Were they chosen as owners precisely because they could be trusted?
- When the property changed hands, was the knowledge lost?

Investigating the Blackstone family records might reveal information about the stone's location and original purpose.
