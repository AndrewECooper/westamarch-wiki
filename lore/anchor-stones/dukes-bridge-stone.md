# The Duke's Bridge Stone

The Duke's Bridge Stone is one of the seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) that comprise [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). It binds [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) hunger—its drive to consume, reclaim, and digest civilization back into the wild. This stone is currently stable but neglected, hidden unknowingly in a commercial warehouse owned by innocent merchants.

## Aspect Bound

**Hunger / Consumption**

The Duke's Bridge Stone suppresses the Greenheart's hunger—its drive to consume, reclaim, and digest civilization back into the wild. This is not the hunger for food, but the forest's patient, inevitable hunger to break down all constructed things and return them to earth. The stone prevents this consuming drive from becoming active and aggressive.

## Location

Beneath a warehouse in the southern part of Duke's Bridge, near the border with the Warrens.

## Access

The Duke's Bridge Stone is accessible but hidden:

- In a commercial warehouse district
- The warehouse is owned by Thorngate Trading Company (a minor merchant house)
- Accessed through the warehouse's basement
- Hidden behind crates and stored goods
- Or from the Undercroft via maintenance tunnel

The warehouse owners have no idea what sits beneath their property.

## The Chamber

The chamber serves dual purpose as storage and prison:

- Small room used as extra storage by the merchants above
- The Anchor Stone is behind stacked crates
- Merchants don't know it's there
- Used to store non-perishable goods
- Dusty, cluttered, neglected
- The stone is completely covered by merchant goods

## Current Condition

**Stable but Neglected**

Despite complete neglect, the Duke's Bridge Stone remains functional:

- No one has checked it in decades
- Covered by merchant goods accumulated over years
- Runes intact but dirty
- Glow hidden by the clutter
- The stone's inherent magical resilience has prevented decay
- Structural integrity maintained despite the environment

## Who Knows

**No one currently alive knows about this stone.**

The knowledge has been completely lost:

- The merchant house (Thorngate Trading Company) has owned the building for 80 years
- They have no idea what's in their basement
- Old records might mention "don't disturb the foundation stone"
- But even if such records exist, the context has been lost

The merchants are innocent but unknowing guardians of one of Westmarch's most critical magical artifacts.

## If Damaged (Potential Effects)

If the Duke's Bridge Stone were to be damaged or fail, the effects would manifest as accelerated decay and consumption:

- Decay accelerates near the city
- Wood rots faster than natural
- Food spoils within hours instead of days
- The boundary between the living and the decomposing blurs
- Plants near the walls become subtly carnivorous
- Stone and metal begin to show signs of supernatural corrosion
- The forest's patient hunger becomes active
- It begins **reaching** for the city, wanting to pull it down and digest it
- Buildings show signs of accelerated weathering
- The very ground seems to want to swallow constructed things

## Place of Power: The Maw

The Duke's Bridge Stone is sympathetically connected to **[The Maw](/lore/places-of-power/the-maw)** in the Thornwood.

The Maw is a place where the forest actively consumes. A massive sinkhole where the ground itself seems to digest whatever falls in—bones of animals, remnants of old settlements swallowed during the Green War, even stone slowly dissolving into mulch. The trees here have roots that reach hungrily toward anything warm. Ancient beings dwell here—giants or other creatures who feed endlessly, never satisfied, embodying the forest's hunger to reclaim and consume.

**To repair the Duke's Bridge Stone (if damaged), Source Material from the Maw would be required.**

## Significance

The Duke's Bridge Stone is significant for several reasons:

- **Vulnerable because it's in a commercial area** — High foot traffic makes it both hidden and exposed
- **Easy for conspirators to access if they know about it** — Multiple entry points
- **The merchants are innocent but unknowing guardians** — They would be shocked to learn what they protect
- **Close to the Warrens** — Proximity to the damaged [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) suggests potential connections
- **Represents the complete loss of institutional knowledge** — Even more thoroughly forgotten than the South Market Stone

## The Thorngate Trading Company

The Thorngate Trading Company has unknowingly protected the Duke's Bridge Stone for 80 years:

- A minor but respectable merchant house
- Deal primarily in non-perishable goods (grain, preserved foods, cloth)
- Use the basement for long-term storage
- Have never investigated what's behind the oldest crates
- Might have dusty old property records mentioning the "foundation stone"
- Would be horrified to learn they've been sitting on top of a magical prison component

## Strategic Implications

The Duke's Bridge Stone's location presents unique challenges:

**Advantages:**
- Hidden in plain sight—no one knows to look for it
- Accidental protection from merchants using the space
- Commercial activity provides cover for any investigation
- Multiple access routes provide options

**Vulnerabilities:**
- No one watching means no one protecting
- Merchants might accidentally damage it while rearranging storage
- Commercial building could change hands, leading to renovation
- Conspirators could access it disguised as merchants or workers
- Close proximity to the damaged Warren Stone suggests conspirators may know the area
- If it fails, the merchant family and their workers are in immediate danger

## Relationship to the Greenheart

Hunger and consumption are fundamental to the natural cycle. Everything dies, everything decays, everything returns to earth to feed new growth. This is natural, inevitable, and necessary.

But the Greenheart's hunger is not natural decay. It is active, purposeful, aggressive. When the Greenheart is awake, the forest doesn't wait for things to die—it actively pulls them down, digests them, reclaims them. Civilized structures don't gradually weather over decades; they are consumed within months, broken down and absorbed as if the earth itself is eating them.

The Duke's Bridge Stone prevents this aggressive consumption. It allows natural decay to proceed at its normal pace but prevents the supernatural hunger that would see Westmarch dissolved like food in a stomach.

If this stone were to fail, the city would begin to be digested. Not quickly—not at first—but inevitably. Every building, every wall, every cobblestone would feel the forest's hunger pulling at it, wanting to break it down, return it to earth, feed it back into the cycle.

## Connection to the Warren Stone

The Duke's Bridge Stone's location near the Warrens and its proximity to the damaged [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) raises concerns:

- Did the conspirators who damaged the Warren Stone scout this stone as well?
- Is its continued stability purely because they haven't gotten to it yet?
- Or is there a reason they chose to damage the Warren Stone first?
- The geographical proximity suggests they may know the locations of multiple stones in this area
