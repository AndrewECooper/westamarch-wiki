# The Green War

The Green War (Years 920-940, approximately 320-300 years ago) was a devastating twenty-year conflict between the kingdom and the awakened [Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart). It transformed Westmarch from a prosperous trade town into a military fortress and ultimately led to [The Binding](/lore/the-binding) that imprisoned the forest's consciousness.

## Year 920-925: Confusion and Retreat

**The Opening Years**

No one understood what was happening when the Greenheart awoke. Forest communities (wood elves, druids, fey) were divided—some fled to human cities, some joined the forest, some tried to mediate.

**The Forest Advances**

- Outlying settlements were overrun
- The Thornwood expanded miles, consuming farms and villages
- Refugees flooded to Westmarch and other cities
- The kingdom mobilized armies but didn't understand the enemy

This was not a conventional war. The enemy was the forest itself.

## Year 925-930: Desperate Defense

**Westmarch Transforms**

Westmarch transformed from trade town to military fortress. [The Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)'s fortifications expanded. Thousands of refugees sheltered behind the walls.

**Fighting the Forest**

Armies fought the forest itself—treants, blights, awakened plants. Conventional military tactics proved inadequate against an enemy that could regrow, that had no supply lines to cut, that could not be negotiated with.

**The Discovery**

Druids and scholars began researching what they faced. Some druids discovered the truth: the forest had a consciousness. The Greenheart was discovered and named.

---

## Year 930-935: The Grinding War

**Stalemate**

The forest couldn't break Westmarch. The kingdom couldn't reclaim lost land. Hundreds died monthly.

**Failed Negotiations**

Some tried negotiation with fey and druids who still served the Greenheart. The Greenheart could not be reasoned with—it wanted civilization gone.

**The Dragon's Champion**

Verdanthis the green dragon fought as the Greenheart's champion, leading devastating attacks against human forces.

**Magical Research**

Mages began researching how to fight a living forest. This research would eventually lead to the discovery that the Greenheart could be bound.

---

## Year 935-940: The Final Push

**The Breakthrough**

Mages discovered the Greenheart could be bound through a massive ritual. A coalition formed: mages, clerics, druids (conflicted), and Rangers.

**Locating the Heart**

They located the [Heartwood Sanctuary](/locations/thornwood/heartwood-sanctuary)—the Greenheart's heart, its physical center of power.

**The Campaign**

A massive military campaign pushed into the deep forest:

- Thousands of soldiers fought to reach the Heartwood
- The Rangers guided the way through trackless wilderness
- Mages and clerics prepared the ritual components
- Verdanthis was defeated but not killed (she fled and hid)
- The ritual sites were prepared

## The Cost of War

The Green War exacted a terrible price:

- **Tens of thousands dead** — Soldiers, civilians, refugees
- **Multiple settlements destroyed** — Entire communities consumed by the forest
- **The kingdom nearly bankrupted** — Twenty years of total war exhausted the treasury
- **Deep trauma across a generation** — Those who survived never forgot
- **Druids and Rangers torn between forest and civilization** — Many still bear the scars of this divided loyalty

## Key Locations

### [Harrow Keep](/locations/thornwood/harrow-keep)

A forward military outpost built during the Green War by **Commander Edric Harrow**, positioned twelve miles into the Thornwood to defend supply lines and stage expeditions.

The keep held for nearly a decade (927-934) before being abandoned when the war turned against the kingdom. Commander Harrow was known for his methodical leadership and genuine concern for his soldiers.

From Harrow's letters:

> *"The forest does not sleep. It watches. It waits. It remembers every tree we fell and every path we cut."*

When the forward positions were abandoned in 934, Harrow oversaw the evacuation personally—supplies destroyed, walls partially demolished, every soldier accounted for. He was among the last to leave.

Within a decade of abandonment, the forest had swallowed the keep entirely. Today, its precise location has been lost to official maps, though it lies somewhere along the Westrun's northern tributary. The Poison Scale kobold tribe, servants of Verdanthis, have occupied the ruins for centuries.

### The Heartwood Sanctuary

The final battlefield, where the Binding ritual was conducted. Seven Standing Stones were erected here in a circle around the Greenheart's physical manifestation.

---

## The Aftermath

The Green War ended with [The Binding](/lore/the-binding) in Year 940, forcing the Greenheart into magical unconsciousness. Shortly after, [The Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) was negotiated to maintain the Binding and establish terms for coexistence.

But the forest representatives were deceived—they were not told the full truth about the Binding. They believed they were negotiating a peace treaty, not managing a prison for their forest's consciousness.

The Greenheart never agreed. It was defeated and imprisoned by force.

**And it remembers.**

## Legacy

The Green War shaped everything about modern Westmarch:

- The city's military focus and fortifications
- The Rangers' role as border guardians
- The complex relationship between civilization and forest
- The fear and respect shown to the Thornwood
- The [Anchor Stones](/lore/the-anchor-stones) that hold the Binding in place
- The secret knowledge passed down among the Pact Wardens

For three centuries, Westmarch has lived in the shadow of this war. Most citizens know it only as distant history. But those who know the truth understand: the war never truly ended. It only paused.

And now, the pause is ending.
