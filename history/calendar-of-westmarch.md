# Calendar of Westmarch

The calendar system used in Westmarch and the kingdom follows a twelve-month cycle tied to the seasons.

---

## Year Counting

The current calendar system dates from the **Founding of the Kingdom**. Year 1 marks when the scattered human settlements unified under the first High King and established the Kingdom of Valoreth.

**This happened 1,247 years ago.**

**Current Year:** 1247

---

## The Twelve Months

Each month is **30 days**, with **5 festival days** between years (making a 365-day year).

1. **Deepwinter** (midwinter)
2. **Lastfrost** (late winter)
3. **Greenleaf** (early spring) ← **Current month**
4. **Budding** (mid spring)
5. **Highsun** (late spring/early summer)
6. **Reaping** (midsummer)
7. **Harvestide** (late summer)
8. **Goldleaf** (early autumn)
9. **Dimming** (mid autumn)
10. **Firstfrost** (late autumn)
11. **Longnight** (early winter)
12. **Deepsnow** (midwinter)

---

## Current Date

**Greenleaf 24th, 1247** (Early Spring)

The campaign began on **Greenleaf 14th** when unnatural fog rolled out of the Thornwood and engulfed [The Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens).

---

## The Festival Days

Between the end of Deepsnow and the beginning of Deepwinter, five festival days mark the turning of the year:

1. **Remembrance Day** — Honoring the dead
2. **Midwinter Feast** — Celebration and gift-giving
3. **New Year's Dawn** — Welcoming the new year
4. **Oath Day** — Renewing vows and making new promises
5. **First Light** — Celebrating the returning sun

These days fall outside the normal monthly calendar and are considered sacred time.

---

## Seasonal Significance

The calendar reflects the agricultural and seasonal cycles crucial to life in Westmarch:

- **Winter months** (Deepwinter, Lastfrost, Longnight, Deepsnow) — Cold, survival, planning
- **Spring months** (Greenleaf, Budding, Highsun) — Planting, renewal, growth
- **Summer months** (Reaping, Harvestide) — Growth, abundance, work
- **Autumn months** (Goldleaf, Dimming, Firstfrost) — Harvest, preparation, storing

The proximity to the Thornwood makes seasonal changes particularly significant, as [the Fey Courts](/lore/the-fey-courts) shift power with the equinoxes and solstices.

---

## Historical Dates

Key events are dated using this calendar system:

- **Year 1** — Founding of the Kingdom of Valoreth
- **Year 920** — [The Awakening](/history/timeline#320-years-ago-year-920-the-awakening) of the Greenheart
- **Years 920-940** — [The Green War](/history/the-green-war)
- **Year 940** — [The Binding](/lore/the-binding) and [The Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact)
- **Year 1247** — Current year, the crisis begins

## Notes on Timekeeping

- Days are measured from sunrise to sunrise
- Hours are tracked using sundials, water clocks, and bell towers in the city
- The Temple Quarter's bell tower marks canonical hours for religious observances
- Rangers use natural signs to track time in the wilderness
