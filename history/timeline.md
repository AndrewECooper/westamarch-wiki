# Timeline of Westmarch

This timeline chronicles the history of Westmarch and the Thornwood from the ancient settlement through the present crisis.

---

## 500+ Years Ago: The Ancient Settlement

**Before Westmarch**

A settlement existed on this site (what becomes [Oldtown](/locations/westmarch/oldtown)) at a strategic location: river ford, defensible position, and natural crossroads. It served as a trade route stop between the kingdom's interior and frontier regions.

At this time, the Thornwood existed but was just a large forest. [The Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) slept naturally, undisturbed for millennia. Fey, wood elves, and druids lived peacefully in the forest. Humans and forest dwellers traded and interacted normally.

**Why This Location**

- The convergence of ley lines (unknown to settlers at the time)
- Fertile land and good water (the Westrun River)
- Defensible position with natural barriers
- Trade route nexus

---

## 400-350 Years Ago: Growth and Prosperity

**Settlement Becomes a Town**

The population grew to several thousand. [The Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel) was built as a fortress to protect the settlement. Westmarch became known as a prosperous border town.

Trade with forest communities flourished. Wood elves, druids, and fey visited the markets. Some intermarriage between humans and forest dwellers occurred. The relationship between civilization and forest was harmonious.

**The Name "Westmarch"**

Named because it's the "western march" (border) of the kingdom, marking the edge of civilized lands. Beyond lies the vast Thornwood.

## ~320 Years Ago (Year 920): The Awakening

**Something Wakes the Greenheart**

The exact cause is unclear even to scholars. Possibilities include:

- A natural cycle (the Greenheart periodically wakes)
- Human activity reached a threshold that disturbed it
- A magical catastrophe elsewhere affected it
- Fey politics or conflicts triggered it
- It simply decided to wake

**What Is Known:** One day, the Thornwood changed. The forest became hostile.

**Initial Signs**

- Forest creatures became aggressive without provocation
- Plants began growing unnaturally fast
- Fey turned hostile to humans
- Trees began moving, attacking travelers
- The forest started expanding, literally growing toward settlements

---

## 320-300 Years Ago (Years 920-940): The Green War

See the dedicated page: [The Green War](/history/the-green-war)

**Twenty Years of Devastating Conflict**

This catastrophic war transformed Westmarch from a prosperous trade town into a military fortress and resulted in [The Binding](/lore/the-binding) of the Greenheart.

---

## Year 940: The Binding

**The Ritual of Imprisonment**

After twenty years of war, the kingdom's leadership made a terrible choice: they would imprison the Greenheart rather than try to coexist with it.

**The Participants**

- Dozens of the kingdom's most powerful mages
- High-ranking clerics of multiple gods
- Druids—some willing (saw no alternative), some coerced
- The First Rangers who had fought the entire war

**The Process**

- Seven Standing Stones erected in the [Heartwood Sanctuary](/locations/thornwood/heartwood-sanctuary)
- Seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/the-anchor-stones) placed in Westmarch's foundations
- A massive ritual conducted simultaneously at both locations
- The ritual took three days and nights
- Several participants died during the ritual
- When completed, the Greenheart fell silent

**The Result:** The Greenheart was forced into magical unconsciousness. The forest immediately became less hostile. The expansion stopped.

**Critical Note:** The Greenheart never agreed. It was defeated and imprisoned by force. It did not consent.

---

## Year 940: The Greenwood Pact

**Shortly After the Binding**

[The Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact) was negotiated to maintain the Binding and establish terms for coexistence.

**For the Kingdom**

- Duke Garrick Westmarch (recently granted lordship)
- Royal diplomats
- The most respected Rangers

**For the Forest**

- Archdruid Silvanus (ancient elf, conflicted but pragmatic)
- Representatives of [the Fey Courts](/lore/the-fey-courts)
- Wood elf elders
- The First Rangers who'd always tried to mediate

**The Deception:** The forest representatives believed they were negotiating a peace treaty. They were NOT told the full truth about the Binding—that it was a forced imprisonment, not a mutual agreement for the Greenheart to sleep.

---

## 940-1150: The Peaceful Centuries

**Stability and Prosperity**

Multiple generations lived under the Pact with no major incidents with the forest. Trade flourished. The Rangers maintained boundaries effectively. Minor violations happened but were rare. Westmarch became wealthy and influential.

**Cultural Shift**

- The Green War became distant history
- People stopped believing it could happen again
- The Pact became tradition rather than urgent necessity
- Younger generations more confident, less cautious

**Knowledge Drift**

- Each generation, fewer people told the full truth
- Original participants died or withdrew
- Details became unclear, dismissed as exaggeration
- The urgent threat faded as life normalized

---

## 1150-1200: The Slow Erosion

**Seeds of Future Crisis**

**Small Violations Begin**

- Noble houses secretly log protected groves
- Some hunters venture beyond Border Stones
- A few Rangers become lax in patrols
- Fey retaliate occasionally but nothing major
- Each incident weakens the Binding slightly

**Maintenance Neglect**

- The Anchor Stones need periodic reinforcement
- Those who know the secret grow complacent
- Some maintenance skipped or done improperly
- The Binding slowly degrades

**The Inner Circle Shrinks**

- Pact Wardens die without replacement
- Fewer people brought into the secret
- Knowledge becomes fragmented

---

## 1200-1240: The Gathering Storm

**Warning Signs Appear**

**Forest Changes**

- Rangers report creatures slightly more aggressive
- Plants growing a bit faster in the Green Belt
- A few fey seem hostile for no clear reason
- Nothing dramatic—easily dismissed as normal variation
- But those sensitive to the forest feel something wrong

**Political Tensions Rise**

- Population pressure on the city
- Calls for expansion grow louder
- Lord Brennan begins his political career
- Traditionalists vs. Progressives debate the Pact

**Verdanthis Begins Her Work**

The green dragon who served as the Greenheart's champion during the Green War has been planning for centuries. She starts subtle sabotage, recruits agents and conspirators, begins spreading ideas about expansion, and positions pieces for her ultimate plan.

---

## 1240-1247: The Acceleration

**The Situation Deteriorates**

**Refugees Arrive**

People fleeing from the east report strange things: darkness spreading, crops failing, people changing. Thousands arrive seeking safety in Westmarch, straining city resources and increasing pressure for expansion.

**Violations Increase**

- More logging beyond borders
- More Pact violations on both sides
- Lord Brennan advocates for change
- Secret illegal logging operations
- Fey retaliate more aggressively

**Duke Aldric Discovers Crisis**

During a routine check on the central Anchor Stone, Duke Aldric realizes it's degrading faster than it should. He investigates other stones and discovers some haven't been maintained properly. He realizes the Binding is failing and becomes paranoid and withdrawn.

**The Conspiracy Moves**

- Lord Brennan contacted by Verdanthis's agents
- Agents position themselves in key locations
- Plans to damage Anchor Stones finalized

---

## 1247 (Current Year): The Crisis

**The Breaking Point**

**Six Months Ago**

First Rangers disappear on deep patrol. Never found. Assumed killed by creatures.

**Three Months Ago**

The South Anchor Stone ([The Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens)) is deliberately damaged. Done carefully—not destroyed but weakened. Allows fog to manifest.

**One Month Ago**

- Forest activity intensifies dramatically
- Nightmares begin in western districts
- Plants grow unnaturally fast
- More Rangers disappear

**Greenleaf 14th (Recent)**

Unnatural fog rolls out of Thornwood and engulfs the Warrens. **The campaign begins.**

**Current Date: Greenleaf 24th, 1247**
