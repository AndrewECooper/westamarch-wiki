# Welcome to the Westmarch Campaign

This is the campaign wiki for our **Level Up: Advanced 5e** game set in **Westmarch**, the border city standing between civilization and the ancient **Thornwood Forest**.

For over three hundred years, the city has stood as a bulwark against the forest—protected by the **Greenwood Pact** and the **Binding** that keeps the primordial **Greenheart** asleep. But the Pact is fraying, the Binding is weakening, and the forest is stirring once more.

**Current Date:** Greenleaf 24th, 1247
