# Oldtown

Oldtown is the oldest part of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview) outside [the Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel), surrounding it on all sides. These winding streets and sturdy stone buildings house working-class families who have lived here for generations—skilled laborers, artisans, minor merchants, and those who serve the Citadel.

**Population:** ~1,500

## Overview

Oldtown predates the Green War by centuries. Some of its buildings were constructed on the foundations of the original settlement that stood here over 500 years ago. The streets follow ancient paths, winding and narrow, unlike the more planned layouts of newer districts.

The residents of Oldtown are traditional, proud, and conservative. Many families have lived in the same buildings for multiple generations, passing down homes and businesses from parent to child. They remember the old ways, respect tradition, and view newer residents with some suspicion.

This is a district of steady, honest work—blacksmiths, coopers, masons, tailors, bakers, and others who provide essential services to the city. While not wealthy, Oldtown families are generally stable and take pride in their craftsmanship and reputation.

## Key Locations

The Watchtower is one of the oldest standing structures in the city, having served as a defensive position long before the current Watch organization was established.

## Hidden Geography

### The Old Cellars

Many buildings in Oldtown are constructed on foundations older than the current structures. Some of these cellars are very ancient, dating back to the original settlement.

- Stone basements carved from bedrock
- Some connect to each other through old passages
- A few connect to [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft)

### The Watchtower Secrets

#### The Old Cells

The basement level of the Watchtower contains the Watch's prison cells, but there's more here than meets the eye.

- Standard prison cells for criminals awaiting trial
- Some cells are very old, predating the Green War

### The Forgotten Shrine

Deep in Oldtown, in an abandoned building long forgotten by most residents, lies a pre-Green War shrine to nature gods.

**What's There:**

- Carved walls with prophecies and warnings
- Ancient texts about "the sleeping forest"
- References to cycles of waking and sleeping
- Map fragments showing the Heartwood region

- Could provide clues about the forest's true nature
- Few know this place exists

## Character

Oldtown is a district that values stability, tradition, and community. Its residents are hardworking and practical, skeptical of grand schemes and political maneuvering. They remember when the city was smaller, when everyone knew their neighbors, and when life was simpler.

The district serves as Westmarch's foundation—both literally, in its ancient cellars and connections to [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft), and figuratively, as the working-class heart that keeps the city functioning day by day.
