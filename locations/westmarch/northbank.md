# Northbank

Northbank is the wealthiest and most exclusive district in [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview), physically separated from the rest of the city by the Westrun River. Only the rich live here—successful merchants, minor nobles, and military officers. Large mansions with gardens, pristine streets, and private guards make this a world apart from the rest of the city.

**Population:** ~1,500 (smallest district by population)

## Overview

Northbank developed during Westmarch's prosperous centuries as the wealthy sought separation from the crowded city center. The river provided a natural barrier, and Duke's Bridge became the exclusive connection (besides private boats). Land here is expensive, and maintaining a residence is a status symbol that announces one has "made it."

The district is quiet, clean, and carefully controlled. Private guards supplement the Watch. Servants move discreetly through service alleys. Gardens are immaculately maintained. Everything is designed to project wealth, taste, and power.

Unlike other districts, Northbank feels removed from the city's problems. The crisis affecting [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) seems distant here. The forest is something viewed from windows, not something that threatens daily life. This disconnect breeds both privilege and dangerous blindness.

## Key Locations

### Noble Estates

Large mansions owned by minor nobility and the most successful merchant families.

**Features:**
- Impressive stone or brick construction
- Multiple stories with numerous rooms
- Private gardens and courtyards
- High walls providing privacy and security
- Guard houses for private security
- Stables for personal horses and carriages
- Staff quarters for numerous servants

**Notable Families:**
- Lord Brennan's estate (advocate for expansion and secretly connected to conspiracy)
- Minor nobles with hereditary titles
- Ducal cousins and extended family
- Retired military officers of high rank

**Lifestyle:**
- Social events and dinner parties
- Political networking and alliance building
- Displays of wealth and taste
- Strategic marriages and business partnerships

### Merchant Mansions

Ostentatious homes of the newly wealthy—merchants who made fortunes and want everyone to know.

**Features:**
- More decorative than noble estates (displaying wealth rather than inherited taste)
- Elaborate gardens with exotic plants
- Impressive entryways and gates
- Collections of art and curiosities
- Sometimes gaudy, sometimes genuinely beautiful

**Character:**
- "New money" trying to gain social acceptance
- Some nobles look down on merchant wealth
- Owners sensitive about their status
- Eager to be included in noble social circles

**Business Impact:**
- Homes double as venues for business negotiations
- Impressing partners and clients
- Demonstrating success to attract investment
- Status as collateral for trust

### The River Docks

Where the Westrun River exits the city to the north—small docks for private boats.

**Legitimate Uses:**
- Private boats for wealthy residents
- Pleasure cruises on the river
- Faster travel to other parts of the kingdom
- Importing luxury goods directly
- Status symbol (owning a boat)

**Security Weaknesses:**
- Harder to control than a gate
- Multiple private docks difficult to watch all at once
- River traffic can come and go with less scrutiny
- Guards focus on preventing theft, not monitoring passengers

**Hidden Uses:**
- **Smuggling operations:** Goods moved at night when watch is minimal
- **Covert meetings:** Private boats provide secure, mobile meeting locations
- **Secret travel:** Conspirators use this to enter/leave the city unnoticed
- **Contraband storage:** Boats themselves can hide illegal goods

**Significance:** The River Docks represent a vulnerability in the city's security—a place where wealth and privilege create opportunities for those with ill intent.

### The Western Riverbank

Where the Westrun River enters the city from the west, flowing out of the Thornwood.

**Views:**
- Estates here have clear views of the forest
- Can see the river emerging from the tree line
- Closest Northbank gets to the Thornwood

**Recent Reports:**
- Some residents report seeing lights in the forest at night
- Strange movements along the riverbank
- Sounds carrying across the water
- Disturbances in the river's flow
- Most dismiss these as imagination or natural phenomena

**Significance:** Even in wealthy Northbank, those paying attention can see signs that something is wrong with the Thornwood.

### Private Clubs and Establishments

Exclusive venues where the wealthy gather away from common eyes.

**The River Club:**
- Members-only establishment
- Expensive membership fees
- Fine dining and private dining rooms
- Where deals are made and alliances formed

**The Silver Lance:**
- Fencing and dueling club
- Where young nobles practice martial skills
- Officers' social club
- Maintains traditions of honor and combat

**Various Salons:**
- Private homes hosting intellectual gatherings
- Art appreciation societies
- Music performances for invited guests
- Philosophical discussions and debates

## Hidden Geography

### Smuggling Network

The River Docks' multiple private access points create a smuggling network:

**How It Works:**
- Private boats arrive at night
- Guards on duty are either paid off or distracted
- Goods transferred quickly to warehouses in [Duke's Bridge](/locations/westmarch/dukes-bridge)
- Wealthy sponsors provide cover stories
- Money and influence suppress investigations

**What's Smuggled:**
- Luxury goods avoiding taxes
- Illegal forest materials exceeding permits
- Contraband from outside the kingdom
- Items related to the conspiracy
- Anything wealthy clients will pay premium prices for

**Who's Involved:**
- Some wealthy residents (for profit)
- Criminal organizations (for distribution)
- Corrupt guards (for money)
- Conspirators (for secretive movement)

### Conspirator Connections

Several Northbank residents are connected to the conspiracy to free the Greenheart:

**Lord Brennan:**
- Advocate for breaking the Greenwood Pact
- Secretly in contact with Verdanthis's agents
- Using his influence to push for expansion
- Hosting meetings at his estate
- Providing resources to the conspiracy

**Unknown Others:**
- Other wealthy residents may be involved
- Some knowingly, some manipulated
- Money flowing to suspicious purposes
- Private boats used for secret meetings

## Character

Northbank represents privilege and power. Residents here live insulated from the struggles facing most of Westmarch. They have influence, wealth, and the ability to shape the city's future—but many are disconnected from the reality of what that future might bring.

The district embodies both civilization's greatest achievements (art, culture, refined society) and its greatest weaknesses (arrogance, willful blindness, the belief that wealth can solve any problem).

Some residents are genuinely good people trying to use their resources for the city's benefit. Others are so focused on maintaining their status that they'll make dangerous choices rather than risk losing what they have.

## Current Tensions

The crisis affects Northbank differently than other districts:

**Economic Impact:**
- Trade disruptions threaten merchant wealth
- Some fortunes are at risk
- Pressure to resolve the situation quickly
- Willingness to consider drastic solutions

**Political Divisions:**
- Some advocate for aggressive expansion
- Others counsel caution and tradition
- Lord Brennan's faction gaining influence
- Old noble families resisting change

**Disconnect:**
- Most residents feel safe across the river
- Don't understand the danger as viscerally as those in [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens)
- Can contemplate breaking the Pact as an abstract political decision
- Don't grasp what renewed war with the forest would actually mean

The [Northbank Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/northbank-stone), one of the seven Anchor Stones maintaining [the Binding](/lore/the-binding), lies somewhere beneath this district—perhaps beneath one of the grand estates, its existence known only to the Duke and the stone's hidden guardians.
