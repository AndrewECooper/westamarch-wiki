## Character

Duke's Bridge represents Westmarch's commercial success and sophistication. Unlike [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens)' desperate poverty or [Northbank](/locations/westmarch/northbank)'s old money, this is where people make their fortunes through cleverness, hard work, and sometimes ruthless business practices.

The district has a hustle and ambition to it—merchants competing for the best deals, craftsmen trying to catch wealthy clients' eyes, and clerks working long hours climbing the commercial ladder. Money talks here, and those with coin find doors open that remain closed to others.

## Current Tensions

The refugee crisis and failing trade routes have impacted Duke's Bridge significantly. Merchants complain about disrupted supply chains, particularly goods that depend on safe passage near the Thornwood. Some advocate loudly for breaking the Greenwood Pact to expand resources, while others fear the economic consequences of renewed conflict.

The Merchant's Collective is divided between those who see opportunity in crisis and those who fear losing everything they've built.
