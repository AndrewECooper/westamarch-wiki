# The Undercroft

The Undercroft is the collective name for [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview)'s sewers, tunnels, and underground spaces. Multiple levels, multiple eras of construction, and partially mapped at best, it forms a dark mirror of the city above—a place where the desperate shelter, criminals operate, and ancient secrets remain hidden.

## What It Is

The Undercroft is not a single system but rather layers of underground construction accumulated over centuries:

**The Sewers (Upper Level):**
- Functional drainage system carrying waste out of the city
- Built during various periods of city expansion
- Some sections well-maintained, others crumbling
- Flow leads to outlets beyond the city walls

**Old Tunnels (Mid Level):**
- Pre-Green War construction
- Original purposes often forgotten
- Some were mines, some storage, some unknown
- More extensive than most realize
- Connect various parts of the city

**Ancient Chambers (Deep Level):**
- Carved from bedrock in forgotten eras
- Predate even [Oldtown](/locations/westmarch/oldtown)
- Purpose unknown
- Some sealed, others accessible
- Possibly connected to the ley line convergence beneath the city

## Major Access Points

### Official Entrances

Maintained by city workers and known to authorities:

- **Maintenance Grates:** Each district has official access points for city workers
- **Watchhouse Entrance:** [The Watchtower](/locations/westmarch/oldtown) in Oldtown has secure access
- **Citadel Tunnels:** [The Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)'s Deep Vaults connect to deeper levels
- **Public Knowledge:** These are documented and (theoretically) controlled

### Secret Entrances

Known to criminals, explorers, and those with reason to move unseen:

- **Cellar Connections:** Many old buildings in [Oldtown](/locations/westmarch/oldtown) have forgotten connections
- **The Shadow Warehouse:** Hidden entrance in [Duke's Bridge](/locations/westmarch/dukes-bridge)
- **Abandoned Buildings:** Throughout [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens), collapsed structures hide access points
- **River Outlets:** Where sewers meet the river, some are navigable
- **Criminal Knowledge:** These locations are jealously guarded secrets

### Anchor Stone Access

At least three of the seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/the-binding) maintaining the Binding are accessible from the Undercroft:

- **[Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/south-market-stone):** Beneath [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens), recently damaged
- **[Duke's Bridge Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/dukes-bridge-stone):** Accessible from tunnels under the commercial district
- **Others:** Exact locations known only to a few

## What's Down There

### Infrastructure

**Working Sewers:**
- Channels carrying waste and rainwater
- Stone-lined passages (mostly functional)
- Flow variations—sometimes dry, sometimes rushing
- Maintenance platforms along main channels

**Collapsed Sections:**
- Cave-ins blocking passages
- Unstable areas ready to collapse
- Sometimes revealing deeper levels
- Creating dead ends and traps

**Old Storerooms:**
- Forgotten chambers once used for storage
- Now housing criminal caches
- Some still containing ancient goods
- Occasionally valuable discoveries

### Inhabitants

**The Desperate:**
- Homeless seeking shelter from weather
- Refugees with nowhere else to go
- Fugitives hiding from authorities
- Usually keep to upper, safer sections

**Criminals:**
- Smugglers using tunnels to move goods
- Thieves' guild meeting spaces
- Hideouts for wanted criminals
- Storage for contraband and stolen goods
- Criminal highways between districts

**Creatures:**
- **Rats:** Enormous, aggressive, sometimes diseased
- **Oozes:** Slimes feeding on waste and decay
- **Worse Things:** Rumors of creatures from below
- **Mutated Animals:** Exposed to magical runoff
- **Things That Hunt:** Predators that learned to live in darkness

### Secrets

**The Anchor Stones:**
- Three or more of the seven stones
- Hidden in chambers throughout the system
- Guarded by wards and traps
- Critical to maintaining [the Binding](/lore/the-binding)
- Their locations known to very few

**Forgotten Places:**
- Chambers sealed for unknown reasons
- Rooms with ancient writing on walls
- Altars to forgotten gods
- Carvings and artifacts from before the city
- Some places feel *wrong*—avoided even by criminals

**Criminal Infrastructure:**
- Secret meeting rooms
- Hidden vaults
- Smuggling routes between districts
- Cache locations for emergencies
- Maps known only to guild members

## Dangers

### Environmental Hazards

**Getting Lost:**
- Complex maze with few landmarks
- Easy to become disoriented
- Some sections loop or connect unexpectedly
- Torches burn out, leaving darkness
- Many who enter never return

**Collapses and Cave-ins:**
- Old construction constantly deteriorating
- Weight from buildings above
- Water erosion undermining supports
- Sections collapse without warning
- Can trap explorers or worse

**Flooding:**
- When it rains heavily, sewers flood
- Water rises quickly in channels
- Escape routes become impassable
- Strong currents can sweep people away
- Drowning in darkness and filth

**Toxic Gases:**
- Pockets of poisonous fumes
- Particularly in dead-end sections
- Can cause unconsciousness or death
- Invisible and odorless (worst kinds)
- Canaries used by experienced explorers

### Human Dangers

**Criminals:**
- Don't want witnesses to operations
- Kill to protect territory and secrets
- Ambush unwary explorers
- Ruthless about protecting profits

**Desperate People:**
- Starving refugees may attack for food
- Fugitives fight rather than be captured
- Madness from living in darkness
- Nothing left to lose makes people dangerous

### Unknown Dangers

**Things in the Dark:**
- Creatures that learned to hunt underground
- Possibly escaped experiments or magical mishaps
- Predators attracted by easy prey
- Some say worse things exist deeper down
- Shadows that move wrong

**Magical Anomalies:**
- Strange effects near Anchor Stones
- Wild magic from ley line convergence
- Corrupted areas where reality feels thin
- Places where sounds don't travel right
- Rooms that seem bigger than they should be

## Useful For

Despite the dangers, the Undercroft offers opportunities:

### Movement

- **Travel Unseen:** Move between districts without being noticed
- **Avoid Watch:** Criminals and fugitives can evade patrols
- **Escape Routes:** Multiple exits allow fleeing pursuit
- **Surprise Entry:** Access buildings from below

### Investigation

- **Find Anchor Stones:** Critical for understanding [the Binding](/lore/the-binding)
- **Track Criminals:** Follow smuggling routes
- **Discover Secrets:** Ancient chambers hold forgotten knowledge
- **Understand City:** The infrastructure reveals history

### Resources

- **Criminal Contacts:** Those who need things can find suppliers
- **Hidden Caches:** Valuables stored by criminals (if you can steal from them)
- **Shortcuts:** Know the routes, save time above ground
- **Information:** Listen in the dark, hear secrets

## Navigation

### Known Routes

Experienced guides know relatively safe paths:

- Oldtown to Duke's Bridge (smuggling route)
- Warrens to anywhere (many desperate know these)
- Watchtower to various districts (Watch route)

### Landmarks

What passes for navigation aids underground:

- Numbered maintenance grates
- Carved symbols (criminal gang markers)
- Direction of water flow
- Distance to river sound
- Distinctive chambers or features

### Getting Help

- **Criminal Guides:** Will guide for coin (if they don't rob you)
- **City Workers:** Know official routes (unlikely to help with illegal activities)
- **Maps:** Fragments exist, none complete, many misleading
- **Rangers:** Some have explored (military training)

## Connection to the Crisis

The Undercroft is crucial to the current crisis:

**The Damaged Anchor Stone:**
- [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/south-market-stone) was deliberately sabotaged
- Access required knowledge of the Undercroft
- Conspirators used tunnels to reach it
- More stones may be at risk

**Conspiracy Operations:**
- Secret meetings in hidden chambers
- Moving materials without detection
- Planning away from witnesses
- The tunnels are their highways

**Future Importance:**
- Heroes may need to access Anchor Stones
- Preventing further sabotage requires securing routes
- Understanding the system reveals the conspiracy's capabilities
- The deepest levels may hold answers about the city's true foundations

## Warnings

**Do Not Enter Unprepared:**
- Bring light sources (and backups)
- Rope for marking path back
- Companions (never go alone)
- Weapons for defense
- Knowledge or guide who knows the way

**Respect the Dangers:**
- People die down here regularly
- Getting lost means dying of thirst in darkness
- Not all who enter come back unchanged
- Some things are better left buried

**The Undercroft Remembers:**
- This place is older than the city above
- Layer upon layer of history in darkness
- Some secrets were buried for good reason
- The deepest levels remain unexplored for a reason
