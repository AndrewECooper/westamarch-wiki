# The Citadel

The Citadel is the heart of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview), a massive stone fortress where Duke Aldric Westmarch rules. The keep dominates the city's skyline and houses the ducal court, government offices, elite guards, and the noble family's private quarters.

**Population:** ~500

## Overview

Built over 400 years ago as a fortress to protect the growing settlement, the Citadel has served as the seat of power in Westmarch since the city's early days. During the Green War, its fortifications were expanded significantly, transforming it from a defensive structure into the command center for the kingdom's efforts against the Thornwood.

The fortress is imposing and functional, built from gray stone quarried from the nearby hills. Its walls are thick, its towers tall, and its defenses formidable. Within its walls live the Duke's family, the highest-ranking government officials, elite guards, and essential staff.

## Key Locations

### Westmarch Keep

The central structure of the Citadel, housing the most important functions of governance:

- **Throne Room** — Where Duke Aldric holds court and receives petitions
- **Council Chambers** — Meeting rooms for the Duke's advisors and high-ranking officials
- **Treasury** — Secure vaults containing the city's wealth and important documents (though not the *most* important secrets)
- **Hall of Records** — Official archives of laws, decrees, and administrative documents
- **Duke's Private Chambers** — The ducal family's living quarters on the upper floors

### The Inner Ward

The courtyard and surrounding buildings within the fortress walls:

- **Barracks** — Housing for the elite Citadel Guard
- **Training Grounds** — Yards for combat practice and military drills
- **Stables** — Horses for the Duke's household and mounted guards
- **Gardens** — Formal gardens maintained for the noble family's use

## Hidden Geography

### The Deep Vaults

Located far beneath Westmarch Keep, accessible only through the Duke's private chambers. Most of the court doesn't know these exist.

**Access:**
- Secret door concealed in the Duke's study
- Spiral staircase descending 100+ feet into bedrock
- Multiple locked doors (Duke has the only keys)
- Ancient construction, predating even Oldtown
- Carved directly from bedrock

**The Vault Levels:**

#### Level 1: The Treasury Vault

The apparent bottom level for the few trusted officials who know about the vaults at all.

- Contains some actual treasure, records, and important documents
- A few trusted officials have been granted access here
- Guards stationed here believe this is the deepest level
- Serves as misdirection from the deeper secrets below

#### Level 2: The Hidden Archive

Beyond a secret door in the treasury, known only to the Duke and perhaps one or two others.

- Contains the oldest, most dangerous records
- Original texts about [the Binding](/lore/the-binding)
- Maps showing [Anchor Stone](/lore/the-binding) locations throughout the city
- Journals from the ritual participants who imprisoned the Greenheart
- Historical documents considered too dangerous for general knowledge

#### Level 3: The Binding Chamber

The true bottom of the Deep Vaults, housing the [Central Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/central-stone).

- A circular chamber carved from bedrock
- The Central Anchor Stone stands at its center, inscribed with binding runes
- This is one of seven stones maintaining the Greenheart's imprisonment
- The chamber thrums with barely-contained magical energy
- Only the Duke knows this chamber exists

### The Duke's Escape Tunnel

A secret passage runs from the Deep Vaults to outside the city—an emergency escape route for the ducal family if the city falls.

- Begins in the lowest vault level
- Runs beneath the city walls
- Exits in a concealed location outside Westmarch
- Still functional but unused for generations
- Known only to the Duke and passed down through the Westmarch family

## Significance

The Citadel is more than just the seat of government—it literally holds the keystone of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding). The [Central Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/central-stone) hidden beneath it is the most important of the seven stones maintaining the Greenheart's imprisonment. If this stone were to fail or be destroyed, the entire Binding could collapse.

Duke Aldric's recent paranoia and withdrawal stems from his discovery that the Central Anchor Stone is degrading faster than it should be, threatening the safety of the entire city.
