# The Warrens

The Warrens is the poorest district in the southwest section of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview). Narrow twisting streets, packed buildings, and desperate poverty define this area. Home to day laborers, the unemployed, refugees, and those struggling to survive, the district earned its name from the maze-like layout that resembles a rabbit warren.

**Population:** ~6,500 (largest district by population)

## Overview

The Warrens began as temporary housing for refugees during and after the Green War over 300 years ago. What was meant to be temporary became permanent as successive waves of displaced people settled here. The district has grown organically and chaotically, with buildings added haphazardly, narrow alleys twisting between structures, and minimal city planning.

Despite the hardship, there's strong community here—people look out for each other because no one else will. Neighbors share what little they have, watch each other's children, and band together against threats. The Watch presence is minimal, so residents handle their own problems, which sometimes means rough justice.

The district is closest to the western wall and the Thornwood beyond, making it the most vulnerable to whatever emerges from the forest.

## Key Locations

### The Wayfarers' Hall

A large community center run by the temple of Avandra, providing essential services to refugees and the poor.

**Services Offered:**
- Free meals (thin soup and bread, but better than nothing)
- Temporary shelter for the newly arrived
- Blankets and basic supplies
- Help finding work or housing
- Mediation of disputes
- Basic healing for injuries
- Hope when everything else is gone

**Staff:**
- Priests and volunteers from the Wayfarer's Chapel
- Community members who give what time they can
- Funded by temple donations and charity

**Significance:** For many refugees, the Wayfarers' Hall is their first stop in Westmarch and sometimes their only source of support. It represents civilization's compassion in a harsh environment.

### Newtown

A sub-section of the Warrens where the most recent refugees settle.

**Character:**
- Temporary housing that's become permanent
- Families crowded into spaces meant for one
- Buildings constructed from scrap and salvage
- Streets that are barely paths between structures
- Poorest of the poor live here

**Population:**
- Recent arrivals from the east
- Those fleeing mysterious darkness and crop failures
- Families who've lost everything
- People with haunted eyes and desperate hopes

**Problems:**
- Overcrowding leading to disease
- Lack of sanitation
- Crime preying on the vulnerable
- Tensions between long-time residents and newcomers

### The Western Wall

The district's western edge where the poorest residents live closest to the forest.

**Conditions:**
- Buildings pressed right against the city wall
- Housing so cheap because nobody wants to live here
- Can hear sounds from the Thornwood at night
- Closest to danger if anything comes from the forest

**Recent Reports:**
- Residents report persistent nightmares
- Strange sounds at night—scratching, whispers
- Shadows that move wrong
- Plants growing faster than normal
- Feeling of being watched from beyond the wall

**Significance:** These residents are the first to notice when something is wrong with the forest, though their warnings are often dismissed as superstition by wealthier citizens.

### The Undercroft

The district has multiple access points to [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft), the city's sewer and tunnel system.

**Uses:**
- Some homeless shelter in upper tunnels
- Criminals use it as transportation and hideout
- Smugglers move contraband through here
- Connection to other districts underground
- The [South Market Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/south-market-stone) lies somewhere in the tunnels beneath this district

**Dangers:**
- Easy to get lost in the maze
- Collapses and flooding
- Criminals who don't want witnesses
- Things that hunt in the dark

### Cheap Taverns and Flophouses

The district is dotted with establishments serving those with little coin:

**The Broken Shield:**
- Popular with day laborers
- Watered-down ale at cheap prices
- Sometimes offers work information
- Occasional fights

**The Lucky Copper:**
- Gambling den as much as tavern
- Where people spend their last coins hoping for luck
- Fights happen regularly
- Watched by local criminals

**Various Flophouses:**
- Rooms rented by the night or even by the hour
- Beds in shared rooms
- Minimal security or cleanliness
- Better than sleeping in the street, barely

## Character

The Warrens is a place of survival. People here don't have the luxury of politics or philosophy—they're focused on getting through each day. Finding work. Getting food. Keeping their families safe. Not freezing when winter comes.

But it's also a place of resilience. People help each other. Share resources. Form bonds of community because that's all they have. Children play in the streets despite the poverty. Musicians perform in corners. Life continues even in hardship.

The district has a rough edge—crime happens, violence occurs, and desperation can make people dangerous. But most residents are just trying to live, and they resent outsiders who judge them without understanding their circumstances.

## Current Crisis

The Warrens was the area most affected by the Gray Morning—when unnatural fog rolled out of the Thornwood and engulfed the district. The event began when the [South Market Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/south-market-stone), one of the seven Anchor Stones maintaining [the Binding](/lore/the-binding), was deliberately damaged.

**Effects of the Gray Morning:**
- Unnatural fog filled the streets
- People reported nightmares made real
- Plants grew at impossible speeds
- Strange sounds and visions
- Several residents went missing
- Lingering fear and trauma

**Current Status:**
- The ward placed on the damaged South Market Stone has contained the worst effects
- The fog has receded
- But the district remains unsettled
- Residents fear it will happen again
- Many are considering leaving if they can afford to

**Community Response:**
- Wayfarers' Hall working overtime to help affected families
- Neighbors checking on each other more frequently
- Increased tensions with city authorities who were slow to respond
- Growing desperation and anger

## The [South Market Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/south-market-stone)

Somewhere beneath the Warrens, accessible through [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft), lies one of the seven Anchor Stones. This stone was deliberately damaged three months ago, weakening [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) and allowing the Gray Morning fog to manifest.

The stone now has a protective ward containing the damage, but the deliberate sabotage suggests enemies within the city working to free the Greenheart.
