# Temple Quarter

The Temple Quarter is the spiritual and scholarly heart of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview), located northeast of [Oldtown](/locations/westmarch/oldtown). All five major temples are here, along with the city's Archive. The streets are clean, well-lit, and peaceful. This is where citizens come seeking healing, justice, knowledge, or divine guidance.

**Population:** ~2,500

## Overview

The Temple Quarter was established in the decades following the Green War, when the city's reconstruction included dedicating an entire district to religious institutions. The temples here represent the five deities most important to Westmarch's culture and survival: Bahamut (protection and justice), Silvanus (nature and balance), Erathis (civilization and law), Avandra (travel and luck), and Ioun (knowledge and study).

The district maintains a peaceful, contemplative atmosphere. Street lamps are kept burning through the night, and the Watch maintains a strong presence to ensure safety. Pilgrims and scholars from across the kingdom visit the temples and Archive, making this one of the more cosmopolitan parts of the city.

## Character

The Temple Quarter represents Westmarch's commitment to more than mere survival. Here, the city nurtures its soul—through prayer, study, justice, healing, and wisdom. The district serves as a reminder that civilization means more than walls and weapons; it means law, knowledge, compassion, and faith.

The coexistence of five different temples demonstrates the pluralistic nature of Westmarch's society, while the Archive represents the city's dedication to preserving knowledge even in a frontier setting.

## Current Tensions

The Temple Quarter has not escaped the current crisis. The clergy of Silvanus wrestle with questions about the Greenheart and humanity's relationship with the forest. The Archive's vault contains secrets that some believe should be revealed, while others insist must remain hidden. And all five temples are seeing increased attendance as fearful citizens seek divine protection from the growing darkness.
