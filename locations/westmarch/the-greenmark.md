# The Greenmark

The Greenmark is a middle-class district in the southeast section of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch/overview), home to craftsmen, skilled workers, and those who work with forest resources. Named for its proximity to the forest and the Green Belt beyond the walls, this is also where the Rangers are based, making it the military heart of the border.

**Population:** ~5,000

## Overview

The Greenmark developed during the reconstruction following the Green War as the district most directly connected to the relationship with the Thornwood. It houses those whose livelihoods depend on the forest—legal loggers, herbalists, hunters, trappers, and craftsmen who work with wood and forest materials.

The district has a practical, frontier character. Buildings are well-constructed but functional rather than decorative. Residents value skill and competence over wealth or status. Many have families with long histories of working with the forest, and they understand both its value and its danger better than most city dwellers.

The massive Greenwatch compound dominates the southern section, a constant reminder that this is the front line of civilization's border with the wild.

## Hidden Geography

### The Secret Tunnel

The Rangers maintain a tunnel under the western wall—one of the most closely guarded secrets in Westmarch.

**Why It Exists:**
- The Greenwood Pact forbids a western gate
- Rangers need forest access for patrols
- The tunnel was dug centuries ago shortly after the Binding
- Allows Rangers to enter and exit without violating the letter of the Pact
- Technically violates the spirit of "no expansion" but deemed necessary

**Location:**
- Entrance inside the Greenwatch compound
- In a secured building accessible only to Rangers
- Behind a locked door marked "Storage"
- Hidden trapdoor in the floor leads down

**The Tunnel:**
- Approximately 100 yards long
- Goes under the western wall
- Extends 100 yards into the Green Belt
- Exits in a concealed location in the forest
- Exit hidden by rocks and carefully arranged plants
- Magically warded—Rangers can pass, others trigger alarms
- Well-maintained and reinforced against collapse

**Who Knows:**
- All Rangers know it exists (sworn to secrecy upon joining)
- High Ranger personally oversees it
- Duke Aldric knows
- Very few outside the Rangers
- Not exactly secret from Rangers but they never discuss it with outsiders

**Security:**
- Guards posted near the entrance building
- Magical wards detect unauthorized access
- Alarm system alerts Rangers to intrusion
- Only Rangers can bypass the wards safely

### The Watcher's Post

A secret observation room in the tallest tower of the Greenwatch.

**Purpose:**
- Rangers can observe deep into the forest from here
- Strategic surveillance of Thornwood activity
- Early warning system for threats

**Equipment:**

- Maps marked with sightings and patterns
- Logbook recording observations
- Charts tracking forest changes over time

**Recent Entries:**
- More movement in the deep forest than normal
- Larger creatures seen closer to the border
- Lights at night that shouldn't exist
- Trees that appear to have moved
- Patterns suggesting organized activity
- Overall: more activity than ever recorded before

**Access:**
- Only senior Rangers allowed
- Information kept classified
- Findings reported directly to High Ranger and Duke

## Character

The Greenmark represents the practical relationship between civilization and wilderness. Its residents understand that the forest is both resource and threat, opportunity and danger. They respect the Thornwood's power while making their living from its edges.

The district has less of the desperation of [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) or the pretension of [Northbank](/locations/westmarch/northbank). People here take pride in their skills and competence. A master bowyer or experienced Ranger commands respect regardless of wealth.

## Current Tensions

The Greenmark feels the current crisis acutely. Rangers are going missing. Forest activity increases. The skills and knowledge that kept people safe for generations seem less reliable. Some advocate for stronger action against the Thornwood, while others warn that aggression will make things worse.

The [Greenwatch Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/greenwatch-stone), one of the seven Anchor Stones, lies somewhere within or beneath the Greenwatch compound, though few Rangers know this. The compound's placement was not accidental—it was built where it is to protect this crucial element of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding).
