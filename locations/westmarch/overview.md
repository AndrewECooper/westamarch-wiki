# Westmarch

Westmarch is a walled city of approximately **22,000 people**, built at the western edge of the kingdom where civilization meets the vast [Thornwood Forest](/locations/thornwood/overview). The Westrun River flows through the city from west to east before turning north, dividing the northwestern district from the rest of the city.

The city has stood for over 500 years, though it was transformed 300 years ago when it became the keystone of the Greenwood Pact. The western wall faces the Thornwood with **no gate**—a deliberate choice mandated by the Pact that has become a point of political contention.

## Historical Significance

Westmarch began as a strategic settlement at a river ford over 500 years ago, chosen for its defensible position and location at a natural trade route crossroads. The site was selected (unknowingly) at a convergence of ley lines, which would later prove crucial to [the Binding](/lore/the-binding).

During the Green War (920-940), Westmarch transformed from a prosperous trade town into a military fortress. For twenty years, it stood as the last defense against the awakened Thornwood. The city became the staging ground for the ritual that bound the Greenheart, and seven [Anchor Stones](/lore/the-binding) were placed in its foundations to maintain the magical imprisonment.

For over 200 years afterward, Westmarch prospered under the Greenwood Pact as a center of trade and culture. In recent decades, however, the city has become strained by refugee influx, political tensions over expansion, and the slow degradation of the Binding that protects it.

## The Seven Districts

Westmarch is divided into seven distinct districts, each with its own character and population:

### [The Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)
**Population: ~500**

The heart of Westmarch, a massive stone fortress where Duke Aldric Westmarch rules. The keep dominates the city's skyline and houses the ducal court, government offices, elite guards, and the [Central Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/central-stone) deep beneath in the secret Binding Chamber.

### [Oldtown](/locations/westmarch/oldtown)
**Population: ~1,500**

The oldest part of Westmarch outside the Citadel, surrounding it on all sides. These winding streets and sturdy stone buildings house working-class families who have lived here for generations. Oldtown residents are traditional, proud, and conservative. The Watchtower serves as City Watch headquarters.

### [Temple Quarter](/locations/westmarch/temple-quarter)
**Population: ~2,500**

The spiritual and scholarly heart of Westmarch, located northeast of Oldtown. All five major temples are here, along with the Archive of Ioun. The streets are clean, well-lit, and peaceful—where citizens seek healing, justice, knowledge, or divine guidance.

### [Duke's Bridge](/locations/westmarch/dukes-bridge)
**Population: ~4,000**

The commercial heart of Westmarch, located south of the river and connected to Northbank by the impressive stone bridge that gives the district its name. This is where money flows—fine shops, merchant offices, warehouses, and the bustling Exchange.

### [The Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens)
**Population: ~6,500**

The poorest district in the southwest section of the city. Narrow twisting streets, packed buildings, and desperate poverty. Home to day laborers, the unemployed, refugees, and those struggling to survive. Despite hardship, there's strong community here. Recently affected by the Gray Morning fog when the [South Market Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/south-market-stone) was damaged.

### [The Greenmark](/locations/westmarch/the-greenmark)
**Population: ~5,000**

Middle-class district in the southeast, home to craftsmen, skilled workers, and those who work with forest resources. Named for its proximity to the forest and the Green Belt beyond the walls. This is where the Rangers are based at the Greenwatch, making it the military heart of the border.

### [Northbank](/locations/westmarch/northbank)
**Population: ~1,500**

The wealthiest and most exclusive district, physically separated from the rest of the city by the river. Only the rich live here—successful merchants, minor nobles, and military officers. Large mansions with gardens, pristine streets, and private guards. Living here is a status symbol.

## The Undercroft

Beneath the city lies [the Undercroft](/locations/westmarch/the-undercroft), the collective name for Westmarch's sewers, tunnels, and underground spaces. Multiple levels, multiple eras of construction, partially mapped. At least three Anchor Stones are accessible from these tunnels, making them strategically important and dangerous.

## Current Status

The city stands at a critical juncture. The Binding that has protected Westmarch for three centuries is failing. Strange occurrences plague the western districts—nightmares, unnatural fog, and whispers of the forest stirring. Political tensions run high between those who advocate for expansion beyond the Pact's boundaries and those who remember the old warnings.

The recent Gray Morning fog that engulfed the Warrens has shaken the population's confidence, and many wonder if the peace they've known for generations is coming to an end.
