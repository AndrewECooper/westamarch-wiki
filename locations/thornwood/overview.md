# The Thornwood

The Thornwood is not just a forest—it is the living body of [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart), a primordial nature spirit. Every part of it is connected to this ancient consciousness. The forest is vast, ancient, dangerous, and beautiful. Venturing into it means navigating trackless wilderness, encountering fey creatures with alien motivations, and discovering ancient places that predate human civilization.

## The Living Network

### The Mycelial Web

Beneath the forest floor lies a massive fungal network that connects every tree, plant, and creature. This is the Greenheart's nervous system. Information flows through it. The Greenheart perceives through it. This web is the fundamental infrastructure of the forest's consciousness, allowing the sleeping god to sense disturbances even while bound by [the Binding](/lore/the-binding).

### The Trees

The trees of the Thornwood are not independent organisms—they are part of a single distributed entity. Roots intertwine underground in complex patterns that channel energy and information. When the Greenheart is active, the trees can move. Ancient trees are more deeply connected, possessing a stronger presence of the Greenheart's awareness. Young trees are less integrated but still part of the whole.

The oldest specimens tower hundreds of feet tall, their trunks wider than houses, their canopies creating perpetual twilight beneath them.

### The Creatures

The relationship between the Thornwood's creatures and the Greenheart varies:

- **Natural animals:** Bears, wolves, deer, and birds are less connected but still influenced by the Greenheart's will
- **Awakened creatures:** Directly controlled when the Greenheart is active—intelligent and coordinated
- **Fey:** Separate entities but symbiotic with the forest (see [The Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts))
- **Blights and treants:** Direct manifestations of the Greenheart itself
- **Giant creatures:** Dire bears, massive wolves, winged stags, and intelligent ravens
- **Magical variants:** Nature infused with supernatural power

### Manifestations

When the Greenheart stirs, it creates:

- **Nature spirits:** Elementals of wood and leaf
- **Living spells:** Wild magic given form
- **Dreams made real:** From the Greenheart's sleeping mind

## The Forest's Relationship to the Greenheart

The Thornwood IS the Greenheart's domain and body:

- The forest's age and density relates to how long the Greenheart has dwelt here (millennia)
- When the Greenheart is awake: the forest is **aggressively expansive**—growing unnaturally fast, spawning monsters, spreading like a living thing
- When the Greenheart sleeps: the forest is dangerous wilderness with natural creatures and fey, but not actively malevolent
- Currently, with [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) failing, the forest is beginning to stir—plants grow faster than they should, creatures act with unusual coordination, and the boundary between sleep and waking blurs

## What Lives in the Forest

### Natural Creatures

- Bears, wolves, deer, birds (mundane but unusually large and old)
- Giant versions of normal animals (dire bears, dire wolves)
- Magical variants (winged stags, intelligent ravens, owls that speak riddles)

### Fey Beings

The [Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts) maintain a complicated relationship with the Greenheart:

- Dryads and nymphs (tied to specific trees or waters)
- Satyrs and fauns (mischievous and musical)
- Sprites and pixies (tiny and chaotic)
- Redcaps and bogeys (dark fey, dangerous)
- Unicorns (rare and sacred)
- Archfey and fey lords (powerful entities with alien motivations)

### Awakened Nature

- **Treants:** Ancient, intelligent trees that walk and speak
- **Blights:** Corrupted or twisted plant creatures
- **Vine creatures and shambling mounds:** Ambulatory vegetation
- **Awakened animals:** Beasts that speak and reason

### Dragons

**Verdanthis**, the green dragon, is the primary antagonist working to free the Greenheart. She fought as the Greenheart's champion during the Green War and has spent 300 years planning her revenge.

## Major Locations

### Border and Near Forest

### Places of Power

Several locations in the Thornwood serve as [Places of Power](/lore/places-of-power/overview), each corresponding to a specific [Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) in Westmarch:

- **The Heartwood Sanctuary** — Corresponds to the [Central Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/central-stone) (Will/Consciousness)
- **The Singing Pools** — Corresponds to the [Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) (Sight/Perception)

## Current State

With [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) failing after 300 years, the Thornwood is changing:

- Plants grow faster in the Green Belt, reclaiming cleared land
- Forest creatures show unusual coordination and aggression
- The boundary between civilization and wilderness blurs
- Fey become more active, some turning hostile
- Strange sounds and lights appear near [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch)
- Those sensitive to nature report feeling watched

The forest is waking. The question is whether it can be stopped before [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart) achieves full consciousness and resumes the war that ended 300 years ago.
