# The Singing Pools

The Singing Pools are a network of crystal-clear pools deep in [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood), approximately 45 miles southwest of [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch) (three days' travel). The waters produce strange, melodic sounds and grant visions to those who drink from them. These pools serve as [the Greenheart's](/lore/the-greenheart) primary sensorium—its eyes and ears—and are intrinsically connected to [the Warren Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) in Westmarch.

## Location

- **Distance from Westmarch:** 45 miles southwest (3 days of travel)
- **Terrain:** Deep forest, requiring navigation through dense vegetation
- **Accessibility:** No roads or marked trails; must be guided or navigated carefully
- **Protection:** Guarded by the [Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts) under terms of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact)

## Physical Description

### The Pools

The site consists of seven interconnected pools of varying sizes:

- **Crystal clarity:** Water so clear it appears almost invisible
- **Depth:** The largest pool descends at least 50 feet
- **Temperature:** Cold, even in summer
- **Color:** The water shifts between blue, silver, and green depending on the light
- **Sound:** The pools produce melodic tones—water moving over crystalline formations creates an ethereal song

### The Surrounding Grove

The pools are nestled in a grove of ancient willows and birches:

- Trees lean over the water, their branches creating natural arches
- Moss and ferns cover every surface
- Mist frequently rises from the pools, creating an otherworldly atmosphere
- Strange flowers bloom here year-round, species found nowhere else
- The air feels different—heavier, more aware

### Crystalline Deposits

At the bottom of the deepest pool lie crystalline formations unlike any natural stone:

- **Source Stone material:** The substance from which [the Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) were originally carved
- **Appearance:** Translucent crystal with faint inner light
- **Properties:** Magically receptive, ideal for binding rituals
- **Rarity:** Found only in places deeply connected to [the Greenheart](/lore/the-greenheart)

## Function as a Place of Power

### The Greenheart's Sensorium

The Singing Pools serve as the Greenheart's primary means of perception:

- **Sight:** When active, the Greenheart sees through every pool, every dewdrop, every still water in the Thornwood
- **Awareness:** Even while sleeping, the Greenheart dimly perceives through the pools
- **Visions:** Those who drink from the pools may receive glimpses of what the Greenheart sees or has seen

### Connection to the Warren Stone

The [Warren Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) beneath [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) in Westmarch binds the aspect of **Sight/Perception**:

- The stone suppresses the Greenheart's ability to perceive the world
- When the Warren Stone was damaged, the Greenheart began to see again—dimly, confusedly
- The fog that manifested in the Warrens was sensory chaos bleeding through the damaged binding
- Repairing the stone requires Source Stone material from these pools

## Guardians

### Riven-Vow

[Riven-Vow](/characters/npcs/riven-vow), a Redcap born from a vow of revenge, serves as the primary sentinel of the Pools. He challenges those who approach, demanding proof they understand the nature of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding).

### Lady Oona

[Lady Oona](/characters/npcs/lady-oona) of the Winter Court oversees the Pools under the terms of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact). While bound to allow certain visitors access, she exacts prices for the knowledge the Pools provide.

### Other Guardians

The [Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts) maintain additional protections:

- Sprites and pixies watch from the trees
- Will-o'-wisps lead intruders astray
- The forest itself resists those who approach without permission
- Water spirits dwell in the pools themselves

## Properties and Effects

### Drinking from the Pools

Those who drink the water may experience:

- **Visions:** Glimpses of past, present, or future
- **Insight:** Understanding of things previously hidden
- **Connection:** Temporary awareness of the forest's perspective
- **Disorientation:** The experience is overwhelming and alien
- **Price:** Knowledge from the Pools always costs something

### The Song

The melodic sounds produced by the pools affect those nearby:

- Calming and meditative
- Sometimes contains messages or warnings
- Changes pitch and tone based on the Greenheart's state
- Can be unsettling or beautiful depending on the listener

## Session 3 Events

The party's journey to the Singing Pools is detailed in [Session 3](/sessions/session-3-the-singing-pools):

### Riven-Vow's Challenge

[Riven-Vow](/characters/npcs/riven-vow) demanded the party demonstrate understanding of [the Anchor Stones'](/lore/anchor-stones/overview) purpose. They answered correctly—the stones suppress aspects of the Greenheart—and were granted passage.

### Lady Oona's Price

[Lady Oona](/characters/npcs/lady-oona) required payment for access to the pools:

- [Kaelen Vale](/characters/player-characters/kaelen-vale) accepted a piece of the Sorrow of the Forest—ancient grief that makes those who serve Westmarch's order instinctively distrust his words
- In return, he drank from the pools and received a vision of [Duke Aldric Westmarch](/characters/npcs/duke-aldric-westmarch) desperately trying to maintain the failing [Central Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/central-stone) deep beneath [the Citadel](/locations/westmarch/the-citadel)

### Quill's Recognition

[Lady Oona](/characters/npcs/lady-oona) recognized [Quill](/characters/player-characters/quill) and knew the nature of his curse. She refused to reveal who cursed him or why, claiming his suffering amused her and that he deserved his fate.

### Source Stone Retrieved

The party successfully gathered crystalline material from the bottom of the deepest pool—enough to repair the physical damage to [the Warren Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone).

## Current State

With [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) failing, the Singing Pools are changing:

- The waters grow more agitated
- Visions come more frequently and more vividly
- The song becomes louder, more insistent
- The mist rises higher and lingers longer
- Even the guardians sense something waking

As the Greenheart stirs, its primary organ of perception awakens with it. The Pools are becoming more than they were—no longer passive recording devices but active, searching senses.

## Significance

The Singing Pools represent:

- **The Greenheart's awareness:** Its ability to perceive and understand the world
- **A Place of Power:** One of seven locations corresponding to the seven Anchor Stones
- **A source of truth:** Visions granted here reveal hidden knowledge
- **A strategic resource:** The Source Stone material needed for repairs
- **A threat:** As the Greenheart wakes, its perception grows stronger
