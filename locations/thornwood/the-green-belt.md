# The Green Belt

The Green Belt is the critical buffer zone between [Westmarch's](/locations/westmarch) walls and the Border Stones that mark [the Thornwood's](/locations/thornwood) legal boundary. This zone is kept clear of trees and heavy vegetation through regular [Ranger](/factions/rangers-of-the-green) patrols, limited farming, and permitted logging operations.

## Geography

The Green Belt varies in width depending on location, but typically extends 100-300 yards from the city walls to the Border Stones. The terrain consists of:

- **Cleared grassland:** Maintained through regular cutting and controlled burning
- **Stumps and secondary growth:** Evidence of ongoing clearing efforts
- **Patrol paths:** Well-worn trails used by Rangers
- **Watchtowers:** Wooden structures at strategic points along the boundary
- **Scattered farmsteads:** Small plots worked by those willing to live this close to the forest

## The Border Stones

The Border Stones were erected by the [Fey Courts](/factions/the-fey-courts) at the time of [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact), marking the extent of the Thornwood's boundary as it existed 300 years ago.

### Physical Description

- Standing stones approximately 6-8 feet tall
- Carved with fey runes and natural motifs (leaves, vines, animal shapes)
- Made from stone not native to the region
- Each stone is unique in its carvings but part of a unified pattern
- Emanate subtle fey magic detectable by those sensitive to such things

### Function

The Border Stones serve multiple purposes:

- **Legal boundary:** Define where civilization ends and the Thornwood's domain begins
- **Magical markers:** Create a sympathetic connection that helps maintain [the Binding](/lore/the-binding)
- **Warning:** Signal to both sides where violations of the Pact begin
- **Navigation:** Provide reference points for Rangers and travelers

### Terms of the Pact

According to [the Greenwood Pact](/lore/the-greenwood-pact):

- **The Kingdom agrees:** No logging, hunting, or settlement beyond the Border Stones
- **The Forest agrees:** The Thornwood will not expand past the Border Stones
- **The Green Belt:** The zone between the walls and stones remains clear and neutral

### Current Condition

After 300 years, the Border Stones show signs of age and neglect:

- Most still stand but some are damaged or have fallen
- Some have been moved (deliberately or by natural erosion)
- Carvings have weathered and faded
- A few stones have disappeared entirely
- The forest is creeping past some of them

## Current State

Recently, the Green Belt has become increasingly difficult to maintain:

### Signs of Change

- **Accelerated growth:** Plants regrow faster than they should, even after clearing
- **Encroachment:** The forest edge moves closer to the walls, inch by inch
- **Root systems:** Extensive underground networks reach far past the Border Stones
- **Stubborn vegetation:** Some plants resist all attempts at removal
- **Wildlife boldness:** Creatures venture into the Green Belt more frequently

### Ranger Response

The [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green) have increased patrols and clearing operations, but they're fighting a losing battle. What once required monthly maintenance now needs weekly attention. Some Rangers report feeling disconnected from the forest—as if their dual oath is being rejected by one side of the bargain.

### Western Wall

Those living in [the Warrens](/locations/westmarch/the-warrens) and [the Greenmark](/locations/westmarch/the-greenmark), closest to the western wall, have the clearest view of these changes. Recent reports include:

- Strange sounds at night (rustling, whispers, footsteps with no source)
- Lights moving through the forest (will-o'-wisps or something else)
- The smell of flowers and rot combined
- A sense of being watched from the treeline
- Nightmares of the forest calling them

## Strategic Importance

The Green Belt serves vital functions for [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch):

### Military

- **Early warning:** Provides advance notice of threats from the forest
- **Clear field of fire:** Allows defenders to see and engage approaching dangers
- **Staging ground:** Ranger patrols can intercept problems before they reach the walls

### Psychological

- **Buffer zone:** The physical distance provides mental comfort to citizens
- **Visible commitment:** Regular maintenance demonstrates the city's ongoing vigilance
- **Symbol of control:** Keeping the forest at bay shows civilization's strength

### Magical

- **Part of the Binding:** The cleared zone helps maintain the energy flow that powers [the Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview)
- **Weakening the connection:** The forest encroaching represents the failing of [the Binding](/lore/the-binding)

## The Growing Crisis

As [the Binding](/lore/the-binding) continues to fail, the Green Belt is becoming the most visible sign of the crisis:

- **Public concern:** Citizens can see the forest creeping closer
- **Resource drain:** More Rangers and labor required to maintain the clearing
- **Political tension:** Some call for more aggressive action (push the forest back), while others counsel caution
- **Ranger exhaustion:** Constant clearing operations strain the [Rangers of the Green](/factions/rangers-of-the-green)

If the Green Belt fails completely—if the forest reaches the walls—it will represent both a practical military disaster and a symbolic collapse of the Pact's authority.
