# Harrow Keep

Harrow Keep is a forward military outpost built during the Green War by Commander Edric Harrow. Positioned twelve miles into [the Thornwood](/locations/thornwood) to defend supply lines and stage expeditions, the keep held for nearly a decade (927-934) before being abandoned when the war turned against the kingdom. Today, its precise location has been lost to official maps, though it lies somewhere along the Westrun's northern tributary. The ruins are currently occupied by the Poison Scale kobold tribe, servants of [Verdanthis](/characters/npcs/verdanthis).

## Location

- **Distance from Westmarch:** Approximately 12 miles into the Thornwood
- **Direction:** Along the Westrun's northern tributary
- **Current status:** Location lost to official maps; most consider it a legend
- **Accessibility:** Dense forest has reclaimed all approach routes
- **Danger level:** High—deep enough to be beyond regular Ranger patrols

## Historical Background

### Commander Edric Harrow

The keep's namesake was known for:

- **Methodical leadership:** Careful planning and attention to logistics
- **Concern for his soldiers:** Accounted for every person under his command
- **Understanding of the enemy:** Recognized the forest's true nature

His letters reveal a man who grasped what they faced:

*"The forest does not sleep. It watches. It waits. It remembers every tree we fell and every path we cut."*

### Construction (927)

Built in year 927 of the kingdom's calendar:

- **Purpose:** Forward staging point for expeditions into deep forest
- **Strategic value:** Defended supply lines from Westmarch to forward positions
- **Design:** Stone and timber fortification built for extended siege
- **Garrison:** 200-300 soldiers at full strength
- **Support:** Included stables, armory, granary, barracks, and command quarters

### The Decade of Operation (927-934)

For seven years, Harrow Keep served its purpose:

- Expeditions launched from here reached deep into the Thornwood
- Supply caravans from Westmarch reached the keep and returned safely
- The garrison repelled numerous attacks from forest creatures
- Maps were drawn, intelligence gathered, territory held
- But the cost in lives was constant

### The Turning (934)

In year 934, the war turned decisively against the kingdom:

- Forward positions became untenable
- The Greenheart's forces grew more coordinated and aggressive
- [Verdanthis](/characters/npcs/verdanthis) personally led attacks on human outposts
- Supply lines collapsed under constant assault
- The decision came from high command: abandon the deep forest

### The Evacuation

Commander Harrow oversaw the evacuation personally:

- **Methodical withdrawal:** Every soldier accounted for, no one left behind
- **Scorched earth:** Supplies destroyed, weapons broken, maps burned
- **Partial demolition:** Walls breached, gates smashed, buildings set afire
- **Last to leave:** Harrow was among the final defenders to retreat
- **Complete:** The evacuation succeeded—all personnel reached Westmarch

### The Forest's Reclamation

Within a decade of abandonment:

- The forest swallowed the ruins entirely
- Trees grew through buildings
- Roots broke apart walls
- The approach routes vanished beneath new growth
- The keep became a legend, its location uncertain

## Current State

### Physical Ruins

After 313 years of abandonment:

- **Stone foundations:** Still visible in places, though cracked and overgrown
- **Partial walls:** Some sections still stand, draped in vines
- **Collapsed structures:** Most buildings are rubble covered in moss
- **Ancient trees:** Growing through what remains
- **Hidden chambers:** Underground spaces may still be intact

### The Poison Scale Tribe

A tribe of kobolds has occupied the ruins:

- **Name:** The Poison Scale tribe
- **Allegiance:** Servants of [Verdanthis](/characters/npcs/verdanthis)
- **Duration:** Occupied for centuries, since shortly after abandonment
- **Purpose:** Guard the keep and its treasures
- **Numbers:** Unknown, but likely 50-100 kobolds

#### Organization

The kobolds have made Harrow Keep their home:

- Rebuilt sections of the ruins for habitation
- Created warrens beneath the foundations
- Established defensive positions
- Collected treasures and artifacts
- Maintain watch over the surrounding forest

#### Relationship to Verdanthis

The Poison Scale serve the green dragon:

- Absolute loyalty to Verdanthis
- Execute her commands without question
- Guard items of importance to her plans
- Report on forest activities and intruders

## The Tess-Kydra

The most significant item currently at Harrow Keep is the **Tess-Kydra**, an ancient ritual vessel stolen during the Green War.

### What It Is

- **Description:** A ritual crucible or bowl
- **Age:** Created during or before the Green War
- **Purpose:** Designed for storing and channeling magical power
- **Function:** A caster can invest one spell slot per day; the device stores this power indefinitely and can release it all at once

### Historical Capture

According to historical records:

- Captured when Harrow Keep fell (this is incorrect—the keep was evacuated)
- More likely stolen during a raid or battle elsewhere
- Attributed to kobolds serving Verdanthis
- Taken as spoils or deliberately targeted

### Current Location

As learned in [Session 3](/sessions/session-3-the-singing-pools):

- The Tess-Kydra is held at Harrow Keep
- Guarded by the Poison Scale tribe
- Whether Verdanthis took it for a specific purpose or simply claimed it as treasure, [Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) cannot say
- The party needs it to repair [the Warren Anchor Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone)

### Significance

Without the Tess-Kydra:

- [Westmarch](/locations/westmarch) lacks the magical power to repair damaged [Anchor Stones](/lore/anchor-stones/overview)
- Summoning enough mages from across the kingdom would take months
- [The Binding](/lore/the-binding) continues to fail while they wait
- The party has no way to prevent catastrophe

With the Tess-Kydra:

- Even low-level casters can accumulate power over time
- Multiple casters working together can charge it faster
- The repair becomes feasible
- There's hope of restoring the Binding

## Dangers

### The Kobolds

The Poison Scale are not mere bandits:

- **Organized:** Military discipline from serving Verdanthis
- **Loyal:** Will fight to the death for their dragon
- **Prepared:** Have defended this location for centuries
- **Numerous:** Unknown how many actually inhabit the keep
- **Traps:** Kobolds excel at trap-making; expect many

### The Forest

Twelve miles into the Thornwood means:

- Deep forest with all its attendant dangers
- Likely far enough to encounter awakened creatures
- Potential fey interference
- The forest itself may resist intrusion
- Difficult terrain and easy to become lost

### Verdanthis's Attention

If the party attacks Harrow Keep:

- The Poison Scale will send word to Verdanthis
- She may respond personally or send reinforcements
- The party's actions will definitely attract her attention
- She'll know they understand the importance of the Tess-Kydra
- This could escalate the conspiracy's timeline

### Unknown Factors

After 300+ years, no one knows:

- What else might be stored at Harrow Keep
- What other creatures have made the ruins their home
- Whether magical wards or curses protect certain areas
- What the kobolds have created in their centuries of occupation
- Whether ancient weapons or artifacts from the Green War remain

## Strategic Considerations

### Why the Party Must Go

[Elara Moonwhisper](/characters/npcs/elara-moonwhisper) explained the necessity in [Session 3](/sessions/session-3-the-singing-pools):

- Physical repair of [the Warren Stone](/lore/anchor-stones/warren-stone) is possible with Source Stone from [the Singing Pools](/locations/thornwood/the-singing-pools) (retrieved)
- But recharging the stone requires massive magical power
- The Tess-Kydra is the only practical way to accumulate that power
- Without it, the repair cannot be completed
- Therefore, the party must infiltrate Harrow Keep

### Tactical Challenges

The mission will require:

- **Navigation:** Finding a keep whose location is lost to maps
- **Stealth or combat:** Either avoiding the kobolds or fighting through them
- **Exploration:** Searching potentially extensive ruins
- **Extraction:** Getting the Tess-Kydra out safely
- **Survival:** Making it back to Westmarch alive

## Thematic Significance

Harrow Keep represents:

- **History forgotten:** A critical piece of the past reclaimed by the forest
- **The war's legacy:** Ruins of humanity's failed attempt to conquer the Thornwood
- **Edric Harrow's values:** Evacuation over abandonment, responsibility over expediency
- **Verdanthis's long game:** Holding stolen assets for centuries, waiting for the right moment
- **The party's challenge:** They must venture deep into hostile territory for a chance to save the city

## Party Knowledge

As of Session 3, the party knows:

- Harrow Keep exists somewhere 12 miles into the Thornwood
- The Poison Scale kobolds occupy it
- The kobolds serve Verdanthis
- The Tess-Kydra is held there
- They need the Tess-Kydra to repair the Warren Stone
- Commander Edric Harrow built it during the Green War
- It was evacuated, not captured (though the kobolds moved in after)
