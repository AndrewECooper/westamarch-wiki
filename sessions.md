## Session Index

### [Session 1: The Gray Morning](/sessions/session-1-the-gray-morning)

**Date:** Greenleaf 14th, 1247

Four strangers converge in the fog-choked Warrens to investigate a supernatural crisis. Thick, unnatural fog emerged from the Thornwood overnight, engulfing the western portion of the city. Those who stayed in it too long became disoriented, aggressive, or started walking toward the forest as if called.

**Key Events:**
- Lyrique and Sammael were sent to retrieve Councilor Arissa
- Kaelen and Quill fought an Awakened Shrub that burst through the cobblestones
- The four converged at the Wayfarers' Hall and found devastation
- They descended into the Undercroft and found Arissa's corpse
- They fought a creature of living fog
- They discovered the Warren Anchor Stone—deliberately damaged with tool marks

**Outcome:** The party documented the sabotaged stone and retreated to report their findings. The crisis revealed that Westmarch's foundations hide terrible secrets.

### [Session 2: Into the Thornwood](/sessions/session-2-the-gray-morning)

**Date:** Greenleaf 15th-17th, 1247

The party seeks answers from the city's leaders and embarks on a journey deep into the ancient forest to retrieve materials needed to repair the damaged stone.

**Key Events:**
- The party reported to their respective patrons
- Chief Archivist Elara coordinated with the temples to ward the damaged stone (temporary containment)
- Archdruid Theron Mossbark identified the inscription and directed the party to the Singing Pools
- The party journeyed three days into the Thornwood
- They encountered Percival, a curious faerie dragon, who warned them of danger
- They reached the Singing Pools
- Riven-Vow, a Redcap sentinel, blocked their path with a riddle: "Do you understand the purpose of the stones?"

**Outcome:** The party answered correctly and were allowed to approach the Pools, setting the stage for their encounter with Lady Oona.

### [Session 3: The Singing Pools](/sessions/session-3-the-singing-pools)

**Date:** Greenleaf 17th-24th, 1247

At the fey-touched Pools, the party learns terrible truths about the city's foundations and pays the price for knowledge.

**Key Events:**
- Lady Oona appeared by the water and demanded a price for access to the Pools
- Kaelen accepted the Sorrow of the Forest as his burden
- He drank from the Pools and received a vision of Duke Aldric kneeling before a great Anchor Stone, desperate and failing to maintain "The Great Vow"
- Lady Oona revealed she knew who Quill was and why he was cursed, but refused to explain
- She confirmed the Binding is failing and that others in Westmarch know the truth
- The party retrieved Source Stone from the bottom of the Pools
- They returned to Westmarch over three days (arrived Greenleaf 20th)
- Kaelen reported to High Ranger Mira, who advised him to keep the vision quiet
- Lyrique reported everything to Lord Brennan
- Quill brought word to Elara, who researched repair methods
- After several days of research (Greenleaf 24th), Elara revealed the need for the Tess-Kydra
- Historical records showed the crucible was captured during the Green War when Harrow Keep fell to kobolds serving Verdanthis
- The Poison Scale kobolds likely still guard it at Harrow Keep

**Outcome:** The party now knows what they need to repair the Warren Stone, but must venture back into the Thornwood to retrieve the Tess-Kydra from a kobold-infested ruin. Meanwhile, Lord Brennan has learned everything through Lyrique's reports.

## Major Revelations

**What the Party Has Learned:**
- The Warren Anchor Stone was deliberately sabotaged—this is a conspiracy, not natural decay
- There may be as many as seven such stones in or around Westmarch
- The stones suppress the forest's vision and perception
- Duke Aldric knows about the stones and is trying to maintain something called "The Great Vow"
- Repairing the stones requires Source Stone (retrieved) and the Tess-Kydra (not yet retrieved)
- The Fey believe the Greenwood Pact contains "an imbalance in the bargain"
- More than one person in Westmarch knows the truth but they aren't talking to each other
- Quill's curse is connected to all of this somehow—Lady Oona knows why but finds his suffering too entertaining to reveal

**What They Don't Know:**
- The full nature of the Greenheart and the Binding
- That Lord Brennan is a traitor feeding their information to the conspiracy
- The locations of the other Anchor Stones
- What happens if the Binding fails completely
- The origin of Quill's curse

---

## Current Situation

**Date:** Greenleaf 24th, 1247

The ward on the Warren Stone is holding, but it's a temporary containment. The party has the Source Stone needed for physical repair, but lacks the Tess-Kydra required to recharge the stone's magic.

**Next Mission:** Journey to Harrow Keep and retrieve the Tess-Kydra from the Poison Scale kobolds.

**Complications:**
- Lord Brennan knows everything the party knows through Lyrique's reports
- High Ranger Mira has advised keeping the Duke's vision quiet
- The Binding continues to weaken
- Time is running out
